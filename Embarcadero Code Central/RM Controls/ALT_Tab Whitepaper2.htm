<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Since the beginning of the Windows
operating system, at least from the release of Windows 95 (Win95) shell,
there have been many bugs found and fixed with the different variants of
the OS. One of the most troublesome, and in my opinion one of the most
trying, has been the <b>ALT-Tab</b> bug.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Now if you don't know what bug I'm
talking about, let me explain. I assume that you know about the Windows
functionality that allows a user to use the key combination of <b>ALT-Tab</b>
to switch between active applications running on the system. When this
functionality is triggered you generally see a small window appear in the
middle of your screen showing the application icons of all the applications
that are currently running, allowing you to select the application you
want to become active.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>The <b>ALT-Tab</b> functionality
starts out working exactly as you would expect but when you've selected
your desired application and you release the <b>ALT-Tab</b> key combination
your chosen application becomes active but for some reason the application
you were in is still on top. It's no longer the active application but
it's still on top of the application that is active!</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>As far as I can tell, this bug first
appeared in the original release of Win95 or to be more specific the Win95
Shell. The Shell is the basic environment that allows Win95, and every
version of the operating system since then, to do its magic. The Shell
is also responsible for how the OS looks by controlling the painting of
controls and system objects within the environment. With the release of
the Win95 Shell, Microsoft</font></font><b><sup><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2>&reg;</font></font></sup></b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>
(MS) created a whole new set of window styles and added other features
to make its OS look new and very fancy.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>For those of you who aren't into
low-level API programming, a window style is how the OS decides how a window
should look and behave. There are two different types of window styles;
the original window styles could be found in the all versions of the Windows
operating system before Win95. Then there are the extended window styles,
which were first introduced with Win95 to introduce extended functionality
to the OS. You can tell that the API constant <b>WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW</b> is
an extended window style because of the "EX" in the name. This particular
window style, according to the Microsoft</font></font><b><sup><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2>&reg;</font></font></sup></b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>
Win32</font></font><b><sup><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=-2>&reg;</font></font></sup></b><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>
API help file, was created to allow programmers to:</font></font>
<blockquote><i><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>"Create a tool window,
which is a window intended to be used as a floating toolbar. A tool window
has a title bar that is shorter than a normal title bar, and the window
title is drawn using a smaller font. A tool window does not appear in the
task bar or in the window that appears when the user presses ALT-TAB"</font></font></i></blockquote>
<font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>As can be seen, MS fully intended this
window style to bypass the standard <b>ALT-Tab</b> functionality. As a
result of this new window style we now have those lovely floating toolbar
windows that can be found in most MS applications.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Except that if you look at the floating
toolbar windows found in most MS applications they don't look exactly like
the toolbar windows that most development environments like Delphi, VB
or even MSVC/C++ create. There is a very good reason for this and that
reason is that a window that has the extended window style <b>WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW</b>
causes the dreaded <b>ALT-Tab</b> bug!</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>To see this behavior take your favorite
development language, mine is Borland's Delphi, and create a simple application
with two windows in it. Now each IDE will be different but in Delphi there
is a property for all windows called BorderStyle. If you set the BorderStyle
of the second window to be bsToolWindow or even bsSizeToolWin you can demonstrate,
with amazing results, the dreaded
<b>ALT-Tab</b> bug. Execute the application,
making sure that both windows are visible at runtime. Select the second
window, also make sure that there is a second application running in the
background so that you can <b>ALT-Tab</b> to it, press the
<b>ALT-Tab</b>
keys once.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>You should now be able to do stuff
in your second application but the test program you just wrote should be
still on top, deactivated but on top! If you return to your test program
and make the main form of your application focused and then try the <b>ALT-Tab</b>
sequence again you should find that your application should behave normally
and disappear to the background.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>I can hear you now, "so just don't
use windows that have that extended window style". Well that would be the
nice simple solution, wouldn't it? Unfortunately that pesky window style
gets used a lot, by things like hint windows. Which brings me to my second
problem.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Hint windows, those wonderful little
yellow boxes that provide us with so much, yet so little, information about
things. Most hint windows do use that extended window style just for the
reasons mentioned in the Window API help manual. If the hint window class
you're using is constructed properly then it won't be a problem, but if
it's not then you can once again suffer from the <b>ALT-Tab</b> bug.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Even MS themselves suffer from it,
although you won't be able to find it in many of their applications these
days. What you should be looking for are the hints that get displayed on
the MS treeview common control. This class is defined in the ComCtl32.DLL
library and is found on every single computer running at least Win95 or
higher.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>This bug is slightly harder to trigger
than the last one, but once you have it figured out it's amazingly simple
and very annoying. To get this one to happen requires another application
with at least three windows. The main window in this application is irrelevant
but necessary. The main focus to this demonstration is the two child windows,
both of which must have a treeview control and one of them must also be
a stay on top window. Arrange the windows in any fashion you want, set
focus to the child window that is not stay on top and leave the mouse pointer
over one of the child windows. Trigger the
<b>ALT-Tab</b> and watch the
behavior.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Depending on where the mouse pointer
is when the <b>ALT-Tab</b> is triggered you will notice different behavior.
If it is over one of the treeviews on a child window then the entire application
will stay on top. If it is on a client or non-client area of a child window
then just that window will stay on top. If the mouse pointer is not in
one of the child windows then the bug never surfaces.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>The treeview control and a window
with the ability to stay on top are the main triggers for this one. A colleague
of mine was finally able to trace this one back to a hint window that the
treeview creates. There is a property of treeviews that allows it to display
a hint if a treenodes label is off the right hand side of the control.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>Moving the mouse over the node shows
the hint allowing the node's full caption to be displayed. If a treeview
is created with that property shut off then this bug never appears. If
that property is turned on after the control has been created then the
bug also never appears. Although if the property is turned on before a
window handle has been assigned to the control then the bug does appear
to return.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>There is a work around for this treeview
bug that I've come up with.&nbsp; The fix itself is not that hard but it
requires creating a new TTreeview descendant and manually implementing
the treeview's hint control.&nbsp; Once that is done the <b>ALT-Tab</b>
doesn't appear and the application seems to work normally.</font></font>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size=-1>This <b>ALT-Tab</b> bug has appeared
in a number of commercial applications that use the <b>WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW</b>
window style and even in applications that don't specifically use it. For
a long time my colleagues and I couldn't figure out what was actually causing
it. Now that it appears that we've solved the non-obvious reason for the
bug, I felt that it was necessary for me to bring it to light and let others
know about it. I hope this paper has actually provided you with some insight
and knowledge that is useful.</font></font>
<p>For those of you who are not big in to developing VCL components, I've
built a "ToolWindow" replacement and a TreeView like descendant that has
had it's hint window fixed.&nbsp; You can find the TrmToolWinForm and the
TrmPathTreeView in version 1.70 of the rmControl library.&nbsp; The rmControl
library is a freeware (with source) library of controls and components
that I've built up over the last couple of years.&nbsp; You can find the
library on the following sites: <a href="http://delphi.icm.edu.pl">DSP</a>,
