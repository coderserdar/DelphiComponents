 * AVERROR code on error)

 * @note On very old libcs it is necessary to set a secure umask before
 *       calling this, av_tempfile() can't call umask itself as it is used in
 *       libraries and could interfere with the calling application.
 * @deprecated as fd numbers cannot be passed saftely between libs on some platforms
