Everyone is free to use this code as they wish, but
if you use it commercially then I wouldn't mind a
little something (mee too!).


OVERVIEW:
=========

This is a little utility component, which allows you to search a
directory for any file or folder.

It wraps the FindFirst/FindNext/FindClose functions, and supplies the
ability to recurse directories.


USAGE:
======

Before activating the component, set up the properties as follows:
Attributes: (set)     file attributes (default [ffReadOnly, ffHidden, ffSysFile])
Directory:  (string)  starting drive:path
Filter:     (string)  files filter (default *.*)
Recurse:    (boolean) (default false)
Sorted:     (boolean) (default true)
StrictRO:   (boolean) (default false)


Brief Description of Properties:
================================

Attributes:
----------
The set of inclusive attributes allowed to be present by any file.  Note that the
set does not include "Archive" since this bit is really only meaningful for file
backup applications.  It also does not include "AnyFile" because this function is
of no relevance.

Directory:
---------
The starting directory for the search.  May be at the root or any level below, and
does not need to have a trailing "\" character included (although it is preferred).

Filter:
------
The files filter (defaults to "*.*") which can be changed to restrict files found.
Multiple filters may be specified, separated by semicolons.  eg *.dll;x*.bp*

Recurse:
-------
By default, only searches the directory specified.
Set this property to TRUE to have it recurse all directories below the one specified

Sorted:
------
By default, sorts the directories and files in alphabetic order, and subdirectories
and files for each directory in turn in alphabetic order.  If multiple filters are
specified and Sorted is selected, duplicate file entries are ignored.
Clear this property to show directories and files as encountered, showing all directories
(and their files) in each level before descending to the next level.

StrictRO:
--------
By default, includes ReadOnly files in the "Normal Files" list.  i.e. any file with the
archive and/or readonly attribute set will always be found. (this is the Borland Delphi
standard)
Set this property to exclude ReadOnly files if the ReadOnly option in "Attributes" is
not set.


USE:
====

Set the published properties (Attributes, Directory, Filter, Recurse, Sorted, StrictRO)
at design-time and/or run-time.

To activate the component use:

hhFindFile1.Execute;

During use, three events are available:
BeforeExecute: called prior to execution
AfterExecute:  called on completion of execution
OnNewPath:     called when scanned path changes

Abort at any time during execution by:

hhFindFile1.Abort := true;

The list of matched files/folders is returned in the Files property (TStrings),
and includes the full path and file name.  You can extract just the filename by using
ExtractFileName(hhFindFile1.Files[index]).

Other properties returned are:
TotalSpace: (longint) returns total file space
TotalFile:  (longint) returns total files (or files+subdirectories) found
TotalDir:   (longint) returns total directories found (only if ffDirectory=true)

INSTALLATION:
=============
Copy the files into a folder on your computer, select Component|Install
in Delphi, click Add, enter the location of FileFind.pas, click OK.
