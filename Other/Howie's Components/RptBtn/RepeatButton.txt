Author:    Howard Harvey

Version:   1.10

HISTORY
-------
V1.10	23/02/00 Added Count read-only property
V1.00   26/08/99 Initial Release


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This component is a derivative of SpeedButton with extensions to
provide repetition of the "OnClick" event while the left mouse
button remains depressed and the mouse is over the button.


INSTALLATION
------------
1. Place the unzipped contents of RptBtn.zip into a suitable directory.
  (Mine is in D:\Borland\Delphi3\Lib\Extras)
2. Start Delphi 3 and select "Component|Install Packages..."
3. Highlight the Extras.dpl file and click "Edit..."
4. Allow Delphi to close the dialog box and open Extras.dpk
5. Select "Add" and find the file RepeatButton.pas
6. Select "Compile"
7. Close the dialog and allow Extras.dpk to be updated
8. hhRepeatButton should now be in the "Howie" tab of the VCL palette,
   as shown with an icon containing a lightning bolt and clock. 


APPLICATION
-----------
[Events]
    All events in SpeedButton, plus:
    OnMouseEnter,
    OnMouseLeave,

"OnMouseEnter" can be used to indicate when the mouse first appears over
the RepeatButton.
"OnMouseLeave" can be used to indicate when the mouse leaves the bounds
of the RepeatButton.
These events may be used to change visible cues (eg colour of the caption).


[Properties]
    All properties in SpeedButton, plus:
    RepeatDelay (default 400),
    RepeatEnable (default false),
    RepeatInterval (default 200),
    Count

"RepeatDelay" (longint) is the "holdoff" time for the first OnClick event
while the left mouse button remains depressed.  Value is milliseconds.

"RepeatEnable" (boolean) must be true to allow multiple clicks.
If RepeatEnable := false, then RepeatButton is the same as SpeedButton
except having the two extra "OnMouseEnter" and "OnMouseLeave" events.

"RepeatInterval" (longint) is the "repeat" time for the subsequent OnClick
events while the left mouse button remains depressed.  Value is milliseconds.
Default value give 5 "OnClick" events per second.

NOTE: Repetion only occurs if:
   1. the button is going from Up to Down (ie a "OnMouseDown" event occurs)
   2. the "RepeatEnable" property is true (ie an interval timer is set)
   3. the left mouse button remains depressed (RepeatDelay or RepeatInterval
      values expire)
i.e. repetition does not occur if the RepeatButton was already Down when the
left mouse button is depressed.

"Count" returns the number of clicks processed while the button was depressed.
This can be accessed at any time by any other event, such as a timer, other
control action, etc., or by using the "OnClick" event from within RepeatButton.
"Count" is a read-only property.  It is reset each time the button is pressed.


OnClick Events
--------------
Using the "OnClick" event allows clicking the RepeatButton to initiate
any desired action, with user defined delay from the initial press and
repetition rate for following vents.  Note that the usual "OnClick" event
occurs when the left mouse button is released, irrespective of any
repetition setting.  Hence an "extra" event will occur at the time the
left mouse button is released.  This event may also be used to read the
"Count" value and terminate repeat action at a given value.


This component has been successfully tested on Delphi3.
Test code is not included.  The component is simple and registers
as hhRepeatButton in the "Howie" component panel.
