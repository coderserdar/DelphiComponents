Delphi Nice Toolbar Package

DESCRIPTION

  This is fix for Delphi IDE that makes it's toolbars look
  better - disabled icons will look grayscaled (instead of 
  B\W shadows)

USAGE

  Build and install this package into the IDE. If you have
  more than one Delphi version on your computer - see 
  comments in uDoDrawHook.pas file

NOTES

  Tested with Delphi 2007 and 2010, but should work on 
  every Delphi version since 8.
  Gradient toolbars should be enabled!
