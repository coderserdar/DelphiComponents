This dictionary was based on the en_GB Myspell dictionary 
which in turn was initially based on a subset of the 
original English wordlist created by Kevin Atkinson for 
Pspell and  Aspell and thus is covered by his original 
LGPL licence. 

The credit for this en_AU dictionary goes to:

Kelvin Eldridge (maintainer)
Jean Hollis Weber
David Wilson

- Words incorrect in Australian English removed
- a list from the previously removed words with corrected spelling was added
- a list of major rivers was added
- a list of place names was added
- a list of Australian mammals was added 
- a list of Aboriginal/Koori words commonly used was added

A total of 119,267 words are now recognized 
by the dictionary.

Of course, special thanks go to the editors of the 
en_GB dictionary (David Bartlett, Brian Kelk and 
Andrew Brown) which provided the starting point
for this dictionary.

The affix file is currently a duplicate of the en_AU.aff
created completely from scratch by David Bartlett and 
Andrew Brown, based on the published 
rules for MySpell and is also provided under the LGPL.
