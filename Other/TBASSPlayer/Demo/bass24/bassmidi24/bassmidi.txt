NOTE: To run the example EXEs, first you will have to copy BASSMIDI.DLL and
      BASS.DLL into the same directory as them.

NOTE: To build the examples, you will need to copy the BASS API into the
      same directory as the BASSMIDI API.

What's the point?
=================
BASSMIDI is an extension to the BASS audio library, enabling the playing of
MIDI files and real-time events, using SF2 soundfonts to provide the sounds.


Requirements
============
BASS 2.4 is required.


Using BASSMIDI
==============
The MIDI format is used in very much the same way as any of the built-in BASS
stream formats - simply call the MIDI stream creation function instead of the
BASS built-in functions. The BASS plugin system (see BASS_PluginLoad) is also
supported.

SF2 soundfonts are used to provide the sounds. There are several soundfonts
available on the internet. One example (Chorium) is available from the BASS
webpage. On Win32, the Creative 28MB (28MBGM.SF2), 8MB (CT8MGM.SF2), 4MB
(CT4MGM.SF2), or 2MB (CT2MGM.SF2) soundfont will be used by default when
present in the Windows system directory.

Win32 version
-------------
To use BASSMIDI with Borland C++ Builder, you'll first have to create a
Borland C++ Builder import library for it. This is done by using the
IMPLIB tool that comes with Borland C++ Builder. Simply execute this:

	IMPLIB BASSMIDIBCB.LIB BASSMIDI.DLL

... and then use BASSMIDIBCB.LIB in your projects to import BASSMIDI.

To use BASSMIDI with LCC-Win32, you'll first have to create a compatible
import library for it. This is done by using the PEDUMP and BUILDLIB
tools that come with LCC-Win32. Run these 2 commands:

	PEDUMP /EXP BASSMIDI.LIB > BASSMIDILCC.EXP
	BUILDLIB BASSMIDILCC.EXP BASSMIDILCC.LIB

... and then use BASSMIDILCC.LIB in your projects to import BASSMIDI.

For the BASS functions that return strings (char*), VB users should use
the VBStrFromAnsiPtr function to convert the returned pointer into a VB
string.

TIP: The BASSMIDI.CHM file should be put in the same directory as the BASS.CHM
     file, so that the BASSMIDI documentation can be accessed from within the
     BASS documentation.

MacOSX version
--------------
A separate "LIB" file is not required for OSX. Using XCode, you can simply
add the DYLIB file to the project. Or using a makefile, you can build your
programs like this, for example:

	gcc yoursource -L. -lbass -lbassmidi -o yourprog

As with LIBBASS.DYLIB, the LIBBASSMIDI.DYLIB file must be put in the same
directory as the executable (it can't just be somewhere in the path).

LIBBASSMIDI.DYLIB is a universal binary, with support for both PowerPC and
Intel Macs. If you want PowerPC-only or Intel-only versions, the included
makefile can create them for you, by typing "make ppc" or "make i386".
