NOTE: To run the example EXEs, first you will have to copy BASSCD.DLL and
      BASS.DLL into the same directory as them.

NOTE: To build the examples, you will need to copy the BASS API into the
      same directory as the BASSCD API.


What's the point?
=================
BASSCD is an extension to the BASS audio library, enabling the streaming
and ripping of CD audio tracks.


Requirements
============
BASS 2.4 is required.


Using BASSCD
=============
The CD format is used in very much the same way as any of the built-in BASS
stream formats, simply call the CD stream creation function instead of the
standard BASS functions. The BASS plugin system (see BASS_PluginLoad) is also
supported for CDA files.

To use BASSCD with Borland C++ Builder, you'll first have to create a
Borland C++ Builder import library for it. This is done by using the
IMPLIB tool that comes with Borland C++ Builder. Simply execute this:

	IMPLIB BASSCDBCB.LIB BASSCD.DLL

... and then use BASSCDBCB.LIB in your projects to import BASSCD.

To use BASSCD with LCC-Win32, you'll first have to create a compatible
import library for it. This is done by using the PEDUMP and BUILDLIB
tools that come with LCC-Win32. Run these 2 commands:

	PEDUMP /EXP BASSCD.LIB > BASSCDLCC.EXP
	BUILDLIB BASSCDLCC.EXP BASSCDLCC.LIB

... and then use BASSCDLCC.LIB in your projects to import BASSCD.

For the BASS functions that return strings (char*), VB users should use
the VBStrFromAnsiPtr function to convert the returned pointer into a VB
string.

TIP: The BASSCD.CHM file should be put in the same directory as the BASS.CHM
     file, so that the BASSCD documentation can be accessed from within the
     BASS documentation.
