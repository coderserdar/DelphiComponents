GrafixDX Lib v0.1a.  Coded by Entity.  
Last Updated: 26.Mar.2000

Just a short doc.

Here is a lib to extend DelphiX's functionality.  There isn't much
here for now but as time goes on this lib will become bigger ;o]

Please note that it only supports 16bit for now.

INSTALLING: just put it in your Delphi search path.

You'll be able to find the demos where you got this.

Hope you like the look of it so far.
