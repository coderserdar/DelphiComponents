 You may use this program for free on the following conditions:
 1) You must give credit to the author of this program, Hori and Peter Kovach
    if you use parts of this code for your own code and put it on the internet
 2) Any proposals for changes or improvements should be addressed directly to
    the author of this program.
 3) The use of this program is on your own risk. The software is provided as
    is without any garanties and warranty. The author is not responsible for
    any damage or losses of any kind caused by the use of this software or the
    software it is intended to be used with.

 To use this program you must have
 1) DELPHI 4, 5 or 6
 2) MS-DirectX 6.0 or higher
 3) The latest DelphiX components from Hori in Japan
 4) The TCollisionTester3DX component ( obs! the colli3DX.pas file must be
    placed in the same directory as DelphiX

 Use a joy stick to control the observer and to shoot bullets
 Alternatively use the arrow-buttons to move and the space button to shoot.

 The TCollisionTester3DX component is CopyRight Henrik Fabricius
 You may always find the newest version at the Delphi3DX page

 You may use this program to learn how to use the TCollisionTester3DX component
 which checkes for collision between the observer and 3D-objects as well as
 between bullets fired by the observer and the 3D-objects. Please consult the
 first part of the source code for the TColllisionTester3DX component to learn
 more about the capabilities of the component.
 You may also use this program and the TcollisionTester3DX component to learn
 work with dynamic arrays.

 The main idea of the TCollisionTester3DX component is to surround each of the
 3D objects by one or more simple 3D-collision objects and to use these objects
 for testing for collisions. The types of objects are box3D - sphere3D -
 ellipsoid3D - cylinder3D and conus3D. Types of materials are solid3D - water3D
 and air3D. Available functional properties are: pickable - shootable and
 fixed3Dobject.
 It is both possible to work with bullets which are fired at a limited speed
 and at an unlimited speed.

 The program shows how to display 3D-objects and how to work with shadows.

 Press on ALT and Enter to acces and to return from Full screen mode.

 Click on the screen to add new 3D-objects. An open dialog appears from which
 you may choose from a list of objects.

 The content of the landscape generating routines in the units terrain and
 field_1 were derived from the C++ code in the book "The Awesome Power of
 Direct3D/DirectX by Peter Kovach".
 Thanks to Peter Kovach at directx.xoom.com for allowing me to include the
 translated code with this program.

 Links to any gaming examples using the DelphiX and TCollisionTester3DX components are
 welcome on the Delphi3DX page.


 History
 --------
 15th of August 1999 : Appearing at the Delphi3DX page.
 16th of August 1999 : Initialisation error removed by introduction of the command                        CollisionTester3DX.ZeroSetIt. Zbuffering used to remove hidden surfaces.
 18th of August 1999 : Hanging during the playing of sounds avoided by changing                   dxwavelist1.items[*].play[true] to false. Removing the possibility to move
         backwards through the 3D-objects. 
 11th of March 2000  : d03D option of DXDraw activated to obtain compability with
 	 the present version of the DelphiX library. Tested with Delphi 5
 22nd of June 2002 : Hardware counter used to introduce a minimum interval of 300 
msecs between bullets. Tested with Delphi 6

 Good Luck

******************************************************************************

 THIS GAME GOES LIKE!

 Use a joystick or the arrows to move around
 Use button 1 on your joy stick or the SPACE button to fire at the objects

 Use the LongShots checkbox to change between bullets which are fired at
 unlimited speed and at limited speed (visible bullets)

 Five 3D objects are seen from the beginning.
 From time to time a new object appears.

 Shoot all the objects to win the game.
 The game is lost if the number of objects increases to 10.

 Use the panel with the radiobuttons to change the number of shots required to
 remove an object.

 Try to move around and see how the program prevents you from moving through
 the solid objects.

 Try to shoot close to the egg shaped object and the sphere to se how well the
 collisionobjects fits the real objects.

 Notice how the sigle boxshaped coll-object surrounding the chair gives an
 unrealistic impression of the shooting of a chair.
