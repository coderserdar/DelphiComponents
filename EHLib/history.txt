EhLib history

Version 3.4

  + Added support of Delphi 8 (VCL.NET).

  In TDBGridEh
   + Added property ToolTips in Footer and ColumnDefValues.Footer.
   + Added property SumValue: Variant in TColumnFooterEh.

   + Added property ShowImageAndText in TColumnEh. Allows to show Image from ImageList 
     and field Text in grid cell simultaneously. Set ImageIndex in OnGetCellParams event.

  In TCustomDBEditEh
   + Added property Images: TCustomImageList. Images from imagelist can appear at the left 
       part of TDBEditEh, TDBDateTimeEditEh, TDBNumberEditEh or TDBLookupComboboxEh.
   + Added event OnGetImageIndex: TGetImageIndexEventEh.
        TGetImageIndexEventEh = procedure(Sender: TObject; var ImageIndex: Integer) of object;
     Event is called when Text or Value in TCustomDBEditEh is changed. Set new ImageIndex 
     depending on Text or Value.

Version 3.3

  For TDBGridEh
   + Added new form 'DBGridEhFindDlgs' - find dialog in DBGridEh.  Dialog allows 
     to find text in the grid: In specified column or on whole grid;
     From any part of field, Whole field or From beging of the field.
     Set new dghDialogFind value to OptionsEh to allows find dialog in DBGridEh.
     Default shortcut to show find dialog in the grid is 'Ctrl-F'. When dghIncSearch 
     also included in the OptionsEh then first pressing 'Ctrl-F' enters the grid in 
     the Increment Search mode and holding 'Ctrl' press 'F' again will show the 
     find dialog.

  In TDBGridEh
   + Added dghDialogFind value to the TDBGridEhOption type (property OptionsEh).

  In TSTColumnFilterEh
   + Added KeyField, ListField, ListSource properties. Now you can adjust combobox
     in SubTitle Filter cell. If Column.STFilter.ListSource is not empty then grid
     will create combobox for such filter cell. ListSource defines the list of values
     in drop-down list, ListField defines field whose values are displayed in 
     drop-down list, KeyField identifies the field in the ListSource dataset whose 
     value will takes to build filter expression.
     
  In TSQLDatasetFeaturesEh
   + Added SupportsLocalLike property. Determines if the dataset supports 'Like' 
     keyword in Filter property. Modules from DataService directory of EhLib archive 
     rewrited to support this property.

  In TMRUListEh
   + Added AutoAdd property of Boolean type. Determines that the edit control will 
     add new Text in MRUList automagically when control loses focus. Default value 
     for property is True. You can use it (set to False) to fill MRUList manually, 
     for instance from database table.

  * Some bugfixes.

Version 3.2
  
  In TDBGridEh 
   + Added ability to fill cell by the value from previous record. 
     You can use "Ctrl+'" key to do it.

   + Added dghDblClickOptimizeColWidth value to the TDBGridEhOption type
     (property OptionsEh). Adding this value to OptionsEh property
     allows grid to set optimal column width (to fit text in cells of column).
     on double-click on ColSizing line.

   + Added ability to show special row (under title) where you can enter 
     expressions in cells for filtering records in dataset. 
     (Expression in the cell can look like: "1", ">=1", ">1 AND <=5", "%TestStr%")
     When cursor reside in the filter cell they can press ENTER to apply filter.

     For automatically filtering data in dataset need to add one of the units 
     EhLib... (EhLibADO, EhLibBDE, EhLibCDS) to 'uses' clause of any unit of your
     project. Now EhLib have objects to filter data in the TClientDataSet, TQuery,
     TTable and TADOQuery. You have to write and register your own object to filter 
     data in DataSet that not present in this list or you can write 
     TDBGridEh.OnApplyFilter event for every grid.

     Added property - STFilter: TSTDBGridEhFilter with subproperties:
       property Local: Boolean - grid does not use it, but object that
         perform filtering can determine whether it will filter locally 
         in dataset or on the server (by adding filter expressions in 
         SQL 'WHERE' clause).
       property Visible: Boolean - Specifies whether the filter row is visible.

   + Added OnApplyFilter event.

   + Added ApplyFilter function in TDatasetFeaturesEh class.

   In TColumnEh
    + Added new property - STFilter: TSTColumnFilterEh;
      with properties
	DataField: String - Specifies the field name that use to 
          filter data if Column.FieldName is not fit for it.
	Visible: Boolean - Specifies whether user can enter expressions
          in filter row for this column.
        ExpressionStr: String - text expression in StFilter cell.
        Expression: TSTFilterExpressionEh - coded expression in StFilter cell.

Version 3.1

  * Changes in TRegPropStorageManEh:
      'Key' property moved from 'published' to 'public' part.
      (C++ Builder does not support HKEY type in published part).

      Added RegistryKey property of TRegistryKeyEh type.

  + Added (in source included version only) preview version of the
    TMemTableEh component. Dataset, which hold all its data in memory, 
    furthermore can fetch data from other dataset's, unload changes 
    back to dataset and support special interface, that allow to 
    view all data without changing active record.

    See detail info in AdvTech\MemTableEh\readme.txt dir.

  + In DBGridEh: Added support of IMemTableEh interface in DataSet 
    that allow to view all data, without changing active record.


Version 3.0

  In TDBDateTimeEditEh

   + New values in TDateTimeKindEh type (property Kind).
       TDateTimeKindEh = (dtkDateEh, dtkTimeEh, dtkDateTimeEh, dtkCustomEh);
   + Added EditFormat property. Now you can type custom date/time format using
     next format elements: 'YY', 'YYYY', 'MM', 'DD', 'HH', 'NN', 'SS'.


  Library is divided to design-time and run-time packages.
  EhLib[XX] - run-time package and DclEhLib[X] - design-time packages, 
  where [XX] is digit number of VCL version:
  [40] for Delphi 4, [50] for Delphi 5, etc;
  And EhLibB[XX] with DclEhLibB[XX] for C++ Builder.


  Upon installation, all components is placed to the separate page in
  components palette with name - 'EhLib'.
  Note that Delphi IDE does not move components to the new default 
  place when you install new version of same component(s). So if you 
  already has EhLib installed, then installation new (3.0) version 
  does not move EhLib components to the 'EhLib' page on components palette.	
  To force Delphi IDE to move compontes to the default place on 
  components palette do next:
  Open menu: Component->Configure Palette.
             Select '[All]' line in Pages listbox.
             Click 'Default Pages' button.


  New componetns: TPropStorageEh, TIniPropStorageManEh, TRegPropStorageManEh.
  Components realize technology to store components properties to/from settings 
  storage such as ini files, registry etc.

  + Added (in source included version only) design-time ClientDataSet edit 
     window. See detail info in AdvTech\CDSDesign\readme.txt dir.


Version 2.6

  + Added Windows XP themes support (Only under Delphi 7).

  + Added (in source included version only) preview restricted 
    version of EhLibCLX - EhLib under Borland Component Library for 
    Cross-Platform.
    See detail info in AdvTech\EhLibCLX\readme.txt dir.

  + Added (in source included version only) preview version of technology 
    to store components properties to/from settings storage such as 
    ini files, registry etc.
    See detail info in AdvTech\PropStorage\readme.txt dir.


Version 2.5

  + Added Delphi 7 support.

  + New units: CalculatorEh - TCalculatorEh, TPopupCalculatorEh
               DbUtilsEh - Utilities to sort data in DataSet from DBGrid
               EhLibADO - Register object that sort data in TADOQuery
               EhLibBDE - Register object that sort data in TQuery
               EhLibCDS - Register object that sort data in TCustomClientDataSet

  In TDbGridEh 
  + Added possiblity to sort data in DataSet after sorting markers         
    will be changed. You have to add dlgAutoSortMarkingEh to OptionsEh,
    set TColumnEh.Title.TitleButton to True for required columns,
    keep OnSortMarkingChanged event empty, add one of the units 
    EhLib... (EhLibADO, EhLibBDE, EhLibCDS) to 'uses' clause of any unit of your
    project. Now EhLib have objects to sort data in TClientDataSet, TQuery
    and TADOQuery. You have to write and register your own object to sort data
    in DataSet that not present in this list.

  + Added SortLocal property in TDBGridEh. Objects that sort data in DataSet
    can use this property to determine how to sort data, on client or on server.

  + Changed highlight coloring in TDBGridEh for multiselected cells and
    active cell when TDBGridEh have not focus when color mode have more then 
    256 color. I recombinate you to use dgAlwaysShowSelection in Options
    and dghRowHighlight in OptionsEh.
    If you want to keep old method of highlighting for all grids set 
    DBGridEhDefaultStyle.LuminateSelection to false (at run time).

  In TDBNumberEditEh and TColumnEh 
  + Added dropped down calculator in TDBNumberEditEh and TColumnEh for numbered 
    fields (need set TColumnEh.ButtonStyle to cbsDropDown).

  In TColumnEh
  + Added DisplayFormat and EditMask properties.

  In TColumnFooterEh
  + Added DisplayFormat property.
     

Version 2.4

  + Added MRUList property (Most recently used values) in all edit 
    controls and TCloumnEh. If MRUList is Active then in time of edit text
    the special listbox will be dropded down where users can select last entered
    values. When user leave edit control or inplace editor in the grid the value
    will be added in MRUList.

  MRUList: TMRUListEh = class(TPersistent)
    property Active: Boolean - MRU list will drop down in time of edit text.
    property CaseSensitive: Boolean - take into account char case.
    property Items: TStrings - list of items.
    property Limit: Integer - max count of items. Old will be deleted.
    property Rows: Integer - Count of rows in dtop down window.
  end;

  To distinguish MRU dropdown box from other, all other dropdown boxes have 3D border.

  + Added new component - TDBCheckBoxEh.
    Can works as in data-aware mode as in usual not data-aware mode.
    If DataField and DataSource properties is not assigned then
    checkbox works in usual not data-aware mode.

    Have Flat and AlwaysShowBorder properties to show in the flat mode.

  In TDropDownBoxEh  (TColumnEh.DropDownBox,  TLookupComboBoxEh.DropDownBox) added property 
  + ListSource of TDataSource type.
    This property will be used when lookup inplace editor in the grid or
    LookupComboBox have focus. It allows to have different list of
    lookup list values for different records of master data.

  In TDBSumList 
  + Added OnAfterRecalcAll event. Event is call after SumList recalculate 
    aggregated values.

  In TDbGridEh 
  + Added OnSumListAfterRecalcAll event. 

Version 2.3

  + Added C++ Builder 6 support.

  In TDBDateTimeEditEh and TDBComboBoxEh 
    + Added OnCloseUp and OnDropDown events.

  In TDBGridEhScrollBar class (DBGridEh.VertScrollBar, HorzScrollBar)
    + Added property ExtScrollBar: TScrollBar.
        Now you can attach external scrollbars to the grid.
  DBGridEh.VertScrollBar can be show in three mode:
   Always show, Never show, Auto show.
   Use property DBGridEh.VertScrollBar.VisibleMode.

  INCOMPATIBILITY: To be more look like DBGrid component the DBGridEh component
   select row (multiselect) on first mouse click when Options have dgMultiSelect 
   value and AllowedSelections have not gstRectangle value.

Version 2.2

  In TDBEditEh
    + Added properties WantTabs and WantReturns.

  INCOMPATIBILITY: In TColumnEh all published properties moved to public section. 
    New TDBGridColumnEh object added that inherited from TColumnEh and have 
    properties in published section. TDBGridEh uses TDBGridColumnEh to create 
    columns. You can have incompatibility if you inherit TColumnEh object. 
    Use TDBGridColumnEh object now.
     
  + Dropdown box in TDBLookupComboBoxEh and TColumnEh for look fields
  now inherited from TCustomDBGridEh. Now dropdown box can have 
  MultiTitle, can fit columns width to window width, can have column lines
  and row lines, allows to change column widths, can have sortmarkers in titles,
  have event that calls when user press title, allows to change characteristics
  of individual column. 

  RESTRICTION: In EhLIb compiled under Delphi 4 or CBuilder 4 dropdown box
    can not resize or move columns or click the titles.

  + Added new unit - DBLookupGrid.Pas, contains TPopupDataGridEh component that 
    uses as Dropdown box in TDBLookupComboBoxEh and TColumnEh for look fields.

  In TColumnEh 
    + Added property DropDownBox of  TColumnDropDownBoxEh type
      TColumnDropDownBoxEh = class(TPersistent)
         property AutoFitColWidths: Boolean;
         property ColumnDefValues: TColumnDefValuesEh;
         property Columns: TDBGridColumnsEh;
         property Options: TDBLookupGridEhOptions;
         property UseMultiTitle: Boolean;
      end;
      using properties of DropDownBox property you can control 
      dropdown box for inplace editor of columns that connected
      to lookup fields.

  In TDBLookupComboboxEh
    + Added  
         property AutoFitColWidths: Boolean;
         property ColumnDefValues: TColumnDefValuesEh;
         property Columns: TDBGridColumnsEh;
         property Options: TDBLookupGridEhOptions;
         property UseMultiTitle: Boolean;
       in TLookupComboboxDropDownBoxEh object 
       (TDBLookupComboboxEh.DropDownBox property)

  In TColumnEh and TDBLookupComboboxEh
    + Added events

       So you can use next syntax to access column by 
       filed name: DBGridEh1['FieldName']

  In TDBEditEh, TDBDateTimeEditEh, TDBComboBoxEh, TDBNumberEditEh and TColumnEh
  added property 
  + EditButtons of TEditButtonsEh type.
  Class TEditButtonsEh is a collection of TEditButton classes.
  So the edit controls and columns can have several edit buttons.

  In TDropDownBoxEh added property 
  + SpecRow of TSpecRowEh type.
  In TColumnEh added property 
  + DropDownSpecRow of TSpecRowEh type.
  TSpecRowEh = class(TPersistent)

  TSpecRowEh represent the special row in dropdown box for lookup
  fields in column of DBGridEh and in TDropDownBoxEh class of
  TDBLookupComboboxEh component. This row will be active when lookup
  field or lookupcombobox have value equals specrow value or when
  value not in list of key value.
  
  * In the OnButtonClick event for TDBComboBoxEh, 
    TDBLookupComboboxEh, TDBDateTimeEditEh the Sender parameter is
    TEditButtonControlEh object. Use TEditButtonControlEh(Sender).Parent 
    syntax to access the edit control whose button have been clicked.

Version 2.0

  EhLib 2.0 does not support Delphi 3 or C++ Builder 3.

  In TDBGridEh
     + For columns that attached to lookup Fields it support
       possibility of changing values if TField.KeyFields and
       TField.LookupKeyFields is kept a list of several
       names of fields (list is separated by semicolon).

     + In TDBGridEhOption type (OptionsEh propery) dghRowHighlight
       value is added - it allows to highlight current record.

     + Added crpDropDownRowsEh and crpDropDownWidthEh values
       in TColumnEhRestoreParam type, it allows to save and restore
       DropDownRows and DropDownWidth properties of TColumnEh
       in/from the registry or ini file.   

     + Added property AllowedSelections: TDBGridEhAllowedSelections;
       TDBGridEhAllowedSelections = set of 
           (gstRecordBookmarks, gstRectangle, gstColumns, gstAll);
       Defines what types of selection is available in grid.
       dgMultiSelect value in Options property also affects

       defines default values for newly created colonies.

  In TColumEh
       + Added OnNotInList event. Operates when user enter 
          a text not kept in the list of values. If this event 
          is assigned then user is automatically allowed to enter 
          a text not kept in the list. Event makes sense if row
          is based on lookup field or PickList is filled or
          PickList and KeyList is filled.

       +  Added OnGetCellParams event:
            TGetColCellParamsEventEh = procedure (Sender: TObject; 
               EditMode: Boolean; Params: TColCellParamsEh) of object;
            TColCellParamsEh = class

             that pressed upper button.
           AutoRepeat - repeat events if mouse is keeping pressed.


  In TDBSumListProducer 
       * State Of working group operations goCount is changed. When in 
         TDBSum installed by GroupOperation = goCount and
         FieldName <> '' that SumValue will contain an amount of records
         for which field <FieldName> is not Null.

  In TDBLookupComboboxEh

   * Component has changed an ancestor, so possible inconsistency of
     functioning with the preceding version.

   + Supports working with lookup fields that containing in
     TField.KeyFields and TField.LookupKeyFields properties the list of
     the several names of fields, in the same way possible enter a list
     of several names of fields in DataField and KeyField properties of
     combobox. List of field names must be separated by semicolon
     (For instance: 'CustNo;EmpNo').

   + Added OnButtonDown event:
       TButtonDownEventEh = procedure(Sender: TObject; TopButton: Boolean;
          var AutoRepeat: Boolean;  var Handled: Boolean) of object;
       TopButton - when style of the button ebsUpDownEh, defines
       that pressed upper button.
       AutoRepeat - repeat events if mouse is keeping pressed.

  Added 4 new components:

    component works in usual not data-aware mode.

    Have Flat and AlwaysShowBorder properties to show
    in the flat mode.


    Have Text (String type) and Value (Variant type) properties.
    Moreover Value can accept Null value or:
    String type for TDBEditEh and TDBComboBoxEh,
    TDateTime, TDate, TTime, Double type for TDBDateTimeEditEh,
    all numeric types for TDBNumberEditEh.

    Have an OnUpdateData event that occurs before writing data
    in DataSet field or in internal variable when not data-aware mode.
    Event is call when component lose the focus or
    when DataSet send PostData event.


  Individual features of components.

    TDBEditEh, TDBComboBoxEh and TDBLookupComboboxEh have WordWrap
    propertiy to show and edit multiline text. Don't forget to hang

       So you can use more powerful mechanism of aggregate values imbedded
       in TClientDataSet component.

   * Some bugfixes.

Version 1.6

    + Added new component TDBLookupComboboxEh:
      Provides all functionality of TDBLookupCombobox and adds 
      several new features as follows:
        Can have flat style.  
        Allows assign values as to KeyValue property just and to 
          display Text property.
        Allows to type (assign) values to Text property not 
          contained in data list (Style = csDropDownEh).
        Allows to hold KeyValue and Text as not affecting to 
          each other values. Take effect when KeyField, ListField, 
          ListSource, DataField and DataSource properties is empty.
        Drop down list can:
          Show titles,
          Have sizing grip,
          Automaticaly set width as sum of DisplayWidth of 
            the list fields (Width = -1),

   * Some bugfixes.


Version 1.58

   In TDBGridEh
    + Added dghIncSearch and dghPreferIncSearch values in TDBGridEhOption 
       type (property OptionsEh).
         dghIncSearch value allows to do increment search in grid.
         dghPreferIncSearch value determine that the grid prefer increment 
         search to cell editing.
        At run time you can use next key for increment searching:
          Ctrl+F - to begin increment searching.
