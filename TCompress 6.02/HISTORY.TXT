1. New TargetPath, MakeDirectories and ExceptionOnFileError
   properties
2. Key property for "locking" compressed data

Version 2.0:
============

April 2nd, 1996: TCompress 2.0 released
Changes from Version 1.5:

1. Both Delphi 1.0 and Delphi 2.0 DCUs included
2. New OnShowProgress event in the TCompress component
3. Help revised and extended
4. New support Web site at www.spis.co.nz/compress.htm


Version 1.5:
============

November 11th, 1995:  COMPONLY.DCU added and COMPRESS.PAS updated to provide for it (new source revision number 1:51).

COMPONLY.DCU is a version of the COMPRESS unit (TCompress component) which does not require the BDE. As such, you can use it for all compression jobs *except* those requiring database operations (e.g. with TCBlobstream, TCDBIMage/TCDBMemo).

Thus, do NOT use COMPONLY if you are planning to use the components in  COMPCTRL.DCU, but rather, use the original COMPRESS.DCU unit.

To use: COMPONLY can't be added to your library if COMPRESS is already there, as it defines the same (TCompress) component.
Thus, remove COMPRESS.DCU from your library (also COMPCTRL.DCU
if present) and rename and add COMPONLY instead. Then go ahead
and use the TCompress component as required.

September 12th, 1995: V1.5 released

LZW replaced with license-free LZH code
Numerous method changes and extensions to implement improvements
