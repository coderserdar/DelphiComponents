Overview
--------

SSL/TLS X509 certificates
-------------------------

There are effectively three classes of SSL/TLS X509 certificates, Domain Validated,
Organisation Validated and Extended Validated, in order of cost and benefit,
usually with three variations, single domain, multiple domains (SANs), and
wildcard.  Adding multiple domains to a certificate can ease administration and
is cheaper than multiple certificates, wild card means any subdmains usually for
the cost of about six single domains.

Domain Validated certificate issuance is mostly automated so they are cheap (or
free), using one of four challenge methods: file validation where the supplier
checks for a specific file under the domain, usually http://domain/.well-known/file,
domain validation where a special DNS record is created that can be accessed by
the supplier, TLS-ALPN SSL SNI (server name indication) validated where an
https://domain/ connection is opened passing data using the ALPN extension, with
the server returning a special self signed SSL certificate. and email validation
where an email is sent to a predefined address at the domain, ie admin@domain,
with a supplier link that must be clicked to confirm receipt and domain ownership.

File, TLS-ALPN and domain validation challenges can be automated, file is easiest
using a simple HTTP server, TLS-ALPN using an HTTPS server, while domain validation
is dependent on being able to access and control the DNS server of which there are
many different products.  Note validating challenges are not instant, the supplier
may have a queue of challenges waiting to the tested, but usually happen within a
couple of minutes. Applications need to be aware the wait may be longer.
Automated wild card certificates typically use the domain validation challenge.

Organisation and Extended Validated certificates can be ordered online, but
require manual validation that the company or organisation legally exists and is
entitled to use the domain name which may take several days or weeks for extended
validation if legal evidence is required.  Once approved, the certificate and be
downloaded automatically.


TSslX509Certs Overview
----------------------

The TSslX509Certs component automatically downloads SSL/TLS X509 certificates from
various suppliers, including free certificates from Let's Encrypt, and commercial
certificates for Digicert, Comodo, Thawte and GeoTrust from CertCentre AG and
Servertastic (not done yet).  The component automates the process from creating
a new private key and certificate request, placing the order, arranging for
domain validated certificates to be checked by various challenge methods,
collecting the certificate and intermediate, creating PEM and PKC12 bundle files
with the private key, then copying the files to the web server ready for
automatic installation. The TSslWSocketServer, TSslHttpServer, TSslHttpAppSrv,
TIcsProxy, TIcsHttpProxy, TSslFtpServer and TIcsIpStrmLog components can assign
a TSslX509Certs component to support automatic certificate ordering of domain
validated certificates with very little extra code.

The component supports the Acme V2 protocol specified in RFC8555 as implemented
by Let's Encrypt to download free domain validated certificates. Note the Acme
protocol is only implemented sufficiently for Let's Encrypt, it is designed
to also handle commercial certificates which are more complicated to process.
The component will be updated to support commercial suppliers with Acme, when
we find one.

You don't need to register with Let's Encrypt, but it only supplies domain
validated certificates so the domains for which you order certificates must
already be registered and have DNS pointing to a live server to satisfy most
challenges.

Commercial suppliers of certificates have their own APIs, usually using HTTP
REST, currently the component supports CertCentre AG https://www.certcenter.de/,
https://www.certcenter.co.uk/ or https://www.certcenter.com/ from where you
can buy certificates issued by Comondo/Sectigo, DigiCert (including GeoTrust,
Symantec and Thawte) and GlobalSign.  You need to register with
CertCentre AG and open a reseller account to pay for any certificates bought,
although for testing most can be cancelled within 30 days without charge.
CertCentre AG uses OAuth2 authentication which is complex to set-up, but then
mostly invisible.  Domain validated certificates can be purchased and downloaded
automatically using file or DNS challenges, other types of certificates can be
ordered and then downloaded when the order is completed.

The TSslX509Certs component includes a database of certificate orders and pending
challenges, allowing certificates to be re-ordered and the supplier periodically
checked to see if a challenge has been successful when the X509 certificate can
be automatically downloaded and installed.  Events are generated upon completion
or failure, allowing the application to inform the user (by email) of certificate
ordering progress.


TSslX509Certs Challenges
------------------------

To authenticate Domain Validated X509 certificates, the TSslX509Certs component
offers various challenge methods, variously used by different suppliers, products
and ICS components.  Challenges work by the supplier generating a short random
phrase which must become accessible on the public internet using the domains for
which a certificate is being ordered to prove that domain is controlled by whoever
placed the order.

ChallFileUNC  - File - Web Server - UNC: copies a small file into the .well-known
                directory of the server using a UNC path, may be any type of web
                server on the same or remote PC.  Once the challenge is done,
                the issued X509 certificate may be copied to that server.
                Requires a web server listening on port 80 and the domain being
                validated and path /.well-known/.  If a certificate is being
                ordered with two or more Alternate Subject Names, separate
                challenges are required for each separate domain name.  Wild card
                certificates are not supported.

ChallFileFtp  - File - Web Server - FTP: similar to ChallFileUNC, but the
                application needs extra code to copy the file using FTP.

ChallFileApp  - File - App Web Server: similar to ChallFileUNC, but handles the
                challenge file virtually without creating any files using a
                little code in the web server onWellKnownDir event to call an
                function in TSslX509Certs where the path is checked and a virtual
                file returned with the challenge data.  Currently supported by
                the SslHttpServer, TSslHttpAppSrv, TIcsProxy and TIcsHttpProxy
                components, see SslHttpAppSrv1WellKnownDir in the sample
                OverbyteIcsSslMultiWebServ1.pas for an example.

ChallFileSrv  - File - Local Web Server: similar to ChallFileApp, but uses a
                local web server TSimpleWebSrv listening on port 80 and the
                domain being validated, provided no other web server is using
                the same port and address.  This is used by the sample
                OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst to order certificates separately without
                needing a web server, and by the TSslFtpServer and TIcsIpStrmLog
                components which don't usually listen on port 80.  The local web
                server is only run while waiting for the challenge to be accessed
                by the supplier, usually about a minute, but can not conflict
                with any other web server on the same IP address.

ChallDnsAuto  - DNS - Automatic: the challenge comprises a TXT record in the
                Domain Name Server Forward Lookup Zone for the domain.  Currently,
                this requires application code to access the DNS server which is
                in the sample OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst.  It uses WMI to access a
                Windows 2012 or later public DNS Server on the same PC.  The next
                release will also support Cloudfare DNS via a REST API, and maybe
                other cloud providers.  The benefit of using DNS is no conflicts
                with web servers, and ordering wild card certificates like
                *.ftptest.org that work with any sub-domains to avoid ordering
                certificates for each.  A certificate may have multiple wild card
                names, such as *.ftptest.org.uk and *.ftptest.co.uk.

ChallDnsMan   - DNS - Manual: similar to ChallDnsAuto, but just calls an event
                in the application which finds an alternate method of updating
                the Domain Name Server, supported in OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst
                which allows DNS to be updated manually before starting the
                actual certificate order.

ChallAlpnApp  - TLS-ALPN - App Web: this challenge uses the normal SSL port 443
                to avoid needing a non-SSL web server running on port 80. A
                special SSL/TLS certificate is created for the domain containing
                the challenge phrase which is returned instead of the normal
                certificate when the SSL client hello includes a special ALPN.
                This needs one line in the onClientConnect event to call a
                function in TSslX509Certs where the certificate is created.
                See the sample OverbyteIcsSslMultiWebServ1.pas for an example.
                Only catch with this challenge is requesting the first certificate
                for a new domain, the server won't start without a certificate,
                so will automatically create a self signed certificate to start.

ChallAlpnSrv  - TLS-ALPN - Local Web: similar to ChallAlpnApp, but uses a local
                web server TSimpleWebSrv listening on port 443 and the domain
                being validated, provided no other web server is using the same
                port and address, see comments about ChallFileSrv above.

ChallAlpnUNC  - TLS-ALPN - Web UNC: similar to ChallAlpnApp, but copies the
                special SSL certificate to another server that is responsible
                for implementing the ALPN part of the process, don't know of
                such a web server.

ChallEmail    - Email Manually:  calls an event in the application, that could
                send an email automatically, only supported for CertCentre.

For all the automated challenges above, the certificate order process involves
first testing the challenge with locally generated data to ensure the servers
are responding correctly from the public internet, then getting the real
challenge data from the supplier and again checking it can be accessed from the
public internet, before asking the supplier to start testing the challenges.
Let's Encrypt currently tests challenges three times from servers on different
networks to avoid DNS spoofing.  In practice this all takes place within
seconds.

Beware that within a few seconds of a certificate order being completed, hackers
will start making intrusion attempts on the server domain name, typically looking
for PHP pages used to administer popular web servers, which ICS applications
will ignore.  This happens because all SSL certificate appear in public
transparency logs, and the hackers watch these logs.


TSslX509Certs Accounts
----------------------

The TSslX509Certs component has a concept of an Account Directory for a
certificate supplier into which all certificate and related files will be saved,
with a database file ics-control.db containing information about the account.
certificate orders and pending challenges.  For Let's Encrypt Acme, the directory
includes an account private key (separate to certificate private keys) that is
used to identify the account, this is created automatically if the directory is
blank. This account private key will be needed to cancel or revoke any
certificates issued using it.  Note an account directory and database can only
be accessed by one application at a time, they can not be shared between
different servers.

When ordering a new certificate, temporary files may be created in the account
directory, the new certificate private key and certificate request.  Once the
order is accepted and an order number is available, these files are renamed to
include the order number for historic purposes, and when the order is completed
a second copy of all files is saved without the order number for final distribution
to the web server, and optionally copied to the web server using a UNC file share.
Note the files without order numbers are always automatically overwritten by new
orders.  So an Let's Encrypt order for the domain test3.telecom-tariffs.co.uk
will generally find the following files upon completion:

ics-control.db
AcmePrivateKey.pem
AcmePublicKey.pem
LE-SA-v1.2-November-15-2017.pdf
LE-5860824-test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-bundle.pem
LE-5860824-test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-certonly.pem
LE-5860824-test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-inters.pem
LE-5860824-test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-privatekey.pem
LE-5860824-test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-request.pem
LE-5860824-test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk.pfx
test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-bundle.pem
test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-certonly.pem
test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-inters.pem
test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-privatekey.pem
test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk-request.pem
test3_telecom-tariffs_co_uk.pfx

There is a PEM certificate signing request (CSR) file, separate PEM files for the
private key, domain certificate and intermediate certificates, then a combined PEM
bundle  with the certificates and private key, and a PKCS12 PFX file which is a
similar bundle that Windows certificate store accepts.  The certificate private
key files (and bundles) may be optionally password protected, the PFX file always
has a password since Windows requires that, it will be 'password' if not otherwise
specified. Note AcmePrivateKey is unprotected.  A wildcard order for
*.telecom-tariffs.co.uk will have a file name x_telecom-tariffs_co_uk since * can
not be used in file names.  Until the order number is available, the file name
will be LE-work, or CC-work for CertCentre.   There are component options to
ignore some of these files, if not needed.


TSslX509Certs Database
----------------------

For each account there is a database file ics-control.db containing information
about the account. certificate orders and pending challenges.  This is a simple
INI file, and is generally updated only by the TSslX509Certs component.

There is an [account] section or record with general information about the
supplier, logging, next order sequence number, account private key (for Let's
Encrypt), etc.

There are then multiple [domain-mydomain] sections or records for each X509 order
placed where my-domain is the Common Name of the certificate, and then one
section or record for each Subject Alternate Name on the certificate
[san-mydomain=mysan] including the Common Name which are used for domain
validation. These records are updated as the order progresses and may be
checked afterwards to see the main files created and certificate details.  The
record may be used to re-order a certificate, but not on the same day a
certificate was downloaded to prevent wild repeated orders.

When an order has been placed, a temporary section [challenge-mysan] is created
for each SAN on the certificate to keep track of challenge progress, effectively
a queue of waiting challenges.  This queue is checked every 30 seconds and
the supplier contacted to see if the challenge has completed or failed, the
section is then removed with the main domain and san records updated.


TSslX509Certs IssueState
-------------------------

The component keeps the IssueState for each order and pending challenge reflecting
the order progress, saved in the database as type TIssueState, as follows:

IssStateNone       - Not started.
IssStateAccount    - Account with certificate supplier has been opened.
IssStateChecked    - Basic local checks completed, chosen domain challenge allowed,
                     such as copying a test file to .WellKnown directory and
                     accessing it by domain name from the public internet or
                     checking a domain name server can be reached.
IssStateChallgReq  - Received acceptable challenge methods and data from supplier,
                     component will prepare some challenges, others may need to
                     done manually or by the application such as DNS.  The
                     challenge data should remain valid for up to a week.
IssStateChallgTest - Challenges have been tested as ready for checking by supplier,
                     .WellKnown and TlsApln have been accessed from the  public
                     internet or the DNS returns the correct TXT record.
IssStateChallgPend - Pending a response from the certificate supplier to the
                     challenges, may be 30 seconds or several days if manual
                     intervention is required.
IssStateChallgOK   - All domain challenges have been passed by the supplier who is
                     now ready to accept a certificate supply request (CSR) and
                     issue the CA signed certificate.
IssStateCollect    - The CA signed certificate has been collected OK.  The
                     certificate can be collected again if something failed.
IssStateInstall    - Certificate has been installed for the server by the
                     component. not supported yet.
IssStateCancel     - Cancelled order, perhaps revoked certificate, so can not
                     collect certificate again.


TSslX509Certs Sample Application
--------------------------------

There is a application Samples\Delphi\SslInternet\OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst.dpr
that illustrates all the functionality of the TSslX509Certs component, allowing
certificates to be ordered and collected by clicking a few buttons.   The
sample also shows all certificates ordered by ICS components and saved in the
account databases and allows them to be re-ordered.

In the following sample descriptions, all the fields and buttons mentioned have
corresponding properties and methods in the TSslX509Certs component itself.

On the Common tab, there are various logging options, to keep track of activity
and for diagnostics when things don't work as expected, if the Log Directory is
not blank.  There are several levels of debug logging from just connections,
through SSL negotiations, then HTTP headers and content, also Json logging for
protocol errors (or changes).  The Domain Challenge Methods are File Web Server
UNC (external), File Web Server FTP (manual), File Local Web Server (built in),
Domain Name Server (manual), Email Manually, TLS-ALPN Cert (next release).  If
using the Local Web Server, specify the IP address from the drop down box and
start it with the button, this IP address must routed to be accessible from the
public internet with any domains requiring certificates pointing at it.  Specify
a Supplier Account Email address for orders, that will receive progress
information. Add an optional private key password and encryption type (3DES) if
needed.  Certificate CSR Origin specifies whether the component should create a
new private key and CSR for a new order, or use files previously created, in
which case both should be specified and many properties will be ignored.  Click
the 'Check CSR' button to read the files and check they contain the correct
domain and the key matches.  Automatic Order Completion being ticked means the
component will check every 30 seconds to see if an order is ready for collection
and finish it automatically.

For CertCentre AG, you must create an account at https://www.certcenter.com/signup
first, then go to Settings, Your Apps & API Keys, under OAuth2 Your Apps, click
the blue + icon to create a new App, with OAuth2 Redirect-URI:
http://localhost:8080/certcenter/. Back in the sample application, on the
CertCentre 0Auth tab, copy the various parameters from your new app to the sample
fields, App Auth URl, Client ID, Client Secret and Redirect-URI, set App Token
URL to https://api.certcenter.com/oauth2/token and scope to write, web server IP
to 127.0.0.1 port 8080.  The first time you access a CertCentre function, OAuth2
authentication will be triggered to display an account login page in your default
browser, then a German language page appears so click the 'Akzeptieren' button
which should result in the sample application completing OAuth2 and displaying
access and refresh tokens with an expiry date and time, and the browser saying
'App Token Generated Successfully'.  The tokens initially remain valid for 24
hours before another login is required, but may be refreshed manually or
automatically before they expire without needing another login. Refreshed tokens
expire after six hours, but can be extended again and again, provided the sample
application is still running.

On the Domain tab set the Certificate Domain Common Name and any Subject
Alternate Names, the sample application will add the Common Name to the SAN list
if not done manually. If Domain Challenge is for UNC file, set the Web Server UNC
HTTP .Well-Known Directory' for the Common Name, and optionally for each SAN if
different.  If the final certificates are to be copied to the web server, set the
Web Server UNC Public Certificates Directory. Clicking the Test Domain Challenges
button set-up challenges for all the domains and try to access them locally, to
prove future challenges will be successful.  If commercial certificates are being
ordered using Email Challenge, each SAN should specify the Approval Email address
required (scroll across the grid).  There are various Output Certificate Formats
that may be ticked or unticked to reduce the number of unneeded files, Separate
PEM Files, PEM Bundle File, PKCS12/PFX Bundle File, PKCS7 Bundle File and CSR
PEM File.

The Cert Admin tab has a lot more fields relating to certificate orders. All
certificates need to specify a Private Key Type and Size depending on security
requirements (generally RSA2048, EC256 is better but not supported by many
certificates), Signature Digest Type usually SHA256, Serial Number Type either
random or sequential (stored in the database), Certificate Period in days,
usually 365 for one year, 366 or more for two years, ignored for Let's Encrypt
which is always 90 days.  For commercial certificates, contact details,
organisation name, address, email and phone numbers are usually required as well.
Note that private keys EdDSA ED25519 and SHA3 hashes are not yet tested since
they are not supported by any certificate suppliers, likewise longer keys and
SHA sizes may not work.


TSslX509Certs ACME/Let's Encrypt Order Process
----------------------------------------------

ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment) is the protocol designed by
Let's Encrypt, currently at draft 16 and which should eventually become an
official RFC.  It is hoped other certificate suppliers will use ACME in future,
but currently only Let's Encrypt.  ACME V1 is partially supported by the
component since it was done before V2 became public, but should generally be
ignored.  Beware Let's Encrypt does not implement any of the ACME draft protocols
precisely, which is difficult for developers, but they are getting closer with V2.

Let's Encrypt offers live and staging servers, the latter is best for testing
since it issue certificates signed by a fake CA and there are fewer rate limits
than the live server which will only issue five duplicate certificates a week
(if ordering goes mad), no more than 50 per domain per week and five failed
domain validations per hour.   The component stops more than one order per
day for each domain.

For local orders using the sample, there are six buttons numbered in the sequence
in which they are used during ordering.  For orders from applications, some of
these steps are combined.

Select a Account Directory for the database and certificates files, either by
typing a path or clicking the square path box to select a Database Directory
using a dialog window.  Click 'Register Account (1)' which will create a new
account private key or open an old one, and then register the account.  Once the
account is open, the Supplier Database tab will be updated with account details
and any certificate orders in the account database, with their issue state and
details.

After completing all the necessary domain name and certificate details on the
Common, Domain and Cert Admin tabs, click 'Check Order (2)' which will check the
challenge method specified on the Common tab is valid and locally test all the
challenges for all domains specified.  If the local order checks succeed, the
order will be written to the account database, and the 'Get Challenges (3)'
button enabled.  The Supplier Database tab will be updated with the new order
with an Issue State of Checked.

Now click the 'Get Challenges (3)' button to start the order process.  Let's
Encrypt is asked to issue challenges for each of the domain names requested,
which the component then prepares and writes to queue records in the database.
As discussed above, challenges may include writing files, creating special
SSL certificates or adding records to a Domain Name Server.  Let's Encrypt
challenge data remains valid for about one week, so the certificate does not
need to ordered immediately, or the same domains may have further certificates
issued without new challenges.  This also allows time for a Domain Name Server
to me manually updated (only for orders from the sample application).  Once
the challenges are ready, the 'Test Challenges (4)' button is enabled and order
state changes to ChallgReq.

Clicking 'Test Challenges (4)' button starts locally test them, to make sure the
domains, files, etc are available from the public internet correctly.  Once
successful the 'Start Challenges (5)' button is enabled and order state changes
to ChallgTest.

Clicking 'Start Challenges (5)' asks Let's Encrypt to test the challenges,
which usually takes from 15 seconds to a minute, unless they are very busy.
there are usually at least three challenge tests from different networks.
The Issue State on the Supplier Database tab will be updated to ChallgPend.

If Automatic Order Completion is enabled (on the Common tab), the component will
check for successful or failed challenges every 10 seconds while the sample
application is running, updating Issue Status to ChallgOK, Collected and
Installed if the order is successful, or None if it fails the challenges or
problems in collecting the certificate.

If Automatic Order Completion is not enabled, clicking the 'Collect Certificate
(6)' button will check if the challenges have been successful and proceed to
collect the new SSL certificate.

Multiple certificate orders may be placed using the same account, without waiting
for earlier orders to be completed.  If the sample application is stopped, the
next time it is run and the Supplier Account opened, any pending orders will be
checked and completed if possible, or failed.

Once all challenges succeed, the component proceeds to collect the certificate.
First, a new private key and certificate signing request will be created and
submitted or old ones uses if so specified on the Common tab. If the CSR matches
the domain challenge, a new domain SSL/TLS X509 certificate is downloaded and
saved including the order number, then the intermediate certificate that will be
needed by the web server, then the PEM and PKCS12 bundles are built by adding the
private key, as detailed above.  Finally the component runs a check to validate
the certificate chain, and reports all the details. If validation passes, all the
files are saved a second time without the order number, as detailed above. and
the Issue Status updated to 'Collected'.  If a Web Server UNC Public Certificate
Directory has been specified, the certificates will be copied to the servers,
and the Issue Status updated to 'Installed'.

Note that Let's Encrypt certificates are only valid for three months since they
are intended to be renewed automatically.

Servers based on TWSocketServer will periodically check for new SSL certificates
(RecheckSslCerts method) and will automatically order and install new
certificates typically 30 days before the old one expires.

Beware the account database is not designed to shared between multiple
applications running at the same time.  So it is better for each application
that will order certificates to use a separate Acme account and directory,
and only use the sample application to briefly check orders.


TSslX509Certs CertCentre Order Process
--------------------------------------

CertCentra AG orders are similar in concept to Let's Encrypt, but require a
commercial reseller account to opened to pay for commercial certificates, as
described earlier.  It is also necessary to choose the Certificate Product
carefully, probably with the assistance of the CertCentre web site, although
the sample application provides basic certificate features and cost.  Note
that Certificate Products change periodically as companies change name, issue
new products or cease old ones.  So renewing orders annually may not always work.

Select a Account Directory for the database and certificates files.  Click the
'Get Profile' button  will trigger OAuth2 if necessary (see earlier), then
check your account  and list the Certificate Products that can be ordered as
a list.  Clicking on a Certificate Product will display details and cost,
similarly to these examples:

PositiveSSL
Cost 6.7 GBP/year
Max Validity: 24 months, Features: "DV","ECC"
CA: Comodo, Refund Period: 30 days
DV Methods: "FILE","DNS","EMAIL"
Predicted Approval Duration: 3 mins

InstantSSL
Cost 23.1 GBP/year
Max Validity: 24 months, Features: "OV","RI","ECC"
CA: Comodo, Refund Period: 30 days
Predicted Approval Duration: 2 hours

PositiveSSL Wildcard
Cost 77. GBP/year
Max Validity: 24 months, Features: "DV","WC","ECC"
CA: Comodo, Refund Period: 30 days
DV Methods: "FILE","DNS","EMAIL"
Predicted Approval Duration: 3 mins

Comodo mit EV Multi-Domain (MDC)
Cost 183.2 GBP/year
Max Validity: 24 months, Features: "EV","SAN","RI","ECC"
CA: Comodo, Refund Period: 30 days
SANMaxHosts: 250 at 60.2 GBP/year each
Predicted Approval Duration: 3 hours


Only certificates showing DV Methods as FILE or DNS can use automated challenges,
EMAIL will need a manual response but collection will be automatic.  Organisation
and Extended validation (OV and EV) are processed manually.  ECC means that
EC private keys are supported.  WC means wild card, SAN is multiple domain names.

For commercial certificates, when checking the order a quotation is returned for
the certificate cost.  The word BUY needs to typed to avoid spending money
too easily, then 'Order Commercial Cert' clicked. The private key and CSR are
generated and the order placed.  A number of errors may occur at this stage,
mostly related to missing fields such as address, telephone, etc.  For domain
validated certificates, challenge validation will then start, being automatic
for file similarly to Acme.  For email validation, organisation and extended
validated certificates, an order number is returned and the process now stalls
 for manual processing.

If Automatic Order Completion is enabled (on the Common tab), the component will
check for successful or failed challenges and completed orders ready to collect
the certificate, and complete them.

The 'List Orders' button will generate a list in the log of recent CertCentre
orders with their order number and status.  For orders that are completed, the
order number can be entered in the field and 'Collect Order' clicked to collect
the certificate, similarly to Acme.  Likewise, specific orders may be cancelled
within 30 days, and certificates revoked if necessary.

The Supplier Database tab also shows any orders for the account in the database,
and allows them to be Collected, Cancelled or Revoked.


TSslX509Certs Own CA Order Process
----------------------------------

For internal network use and testing, it is possible to create your Own
Certificate Authority and issue your own SSL certificates for devices that are
not accessible from the public internet.  To avoid horrible browser warnings,
your CA certificate needs to be installed as a trusted root on each device that
will access servers running certificates issued by the CA.

The sample application has a button that will create self signed SSL certificates
with a 'CA Cert' check box so it can sign other certificates., but the
OverbyteIcsPemTool sample has more control over fields. You should create a new
private key and self signed certificate with your organisation's common name,
ie Magenta Development CA.  Rather than signing certificates directly with the
new trusted CA, it is better create an intermediate CA signed by the trusted CA,
allowing variations of key types and digests, ie Magenta Intermediate EC CA1.
The intermediate CA certificate does not need to be installed on client devices,
only the trusted CA.

On the Own CA tab, the Certificate Directory should be specified, note the
account database for Own CA certificates currently does not store certificate
details so they can not be ordered automatically by TWSocketServer. Then specify
the CA Certificate or Bundle File and CA Private Key File (if not in bundle) and
click the 'Load CA'  button check and load it, with Issued to and Issued by
being shown.

To issue your own signed SSL certificates, the usual settings on the Domain and
Cert Admin tabs should be completed, and the 'CA Signed Cert' button pressed.
The component will then create a new private key and CSR files, then a new
certificate signed by the Own CA, in a process otherwise identical to collecting
an ACME certificate, using a sequential order number, with files saved with and
without the order number and optionally distributed to the web server.  Note
this sample sets common certificate extensions only, for more control you
should create your own CSR using OverbyteIcsPemTool or it's functions.

Each certificate signed by the Own CA is logged to the index.txt database file
in the Certificate Directory, in OpenSSL CA command format, which is tab
delimited with status, expiry date, SHA1 fingerprint, file name, subject and
subject alternate names. This file could be updated if the certificate is
revoked and used to support Certificate Revocation Lists (not implemented).


TSslX509Certs Supplier Database
-------------------------------

As mention above, each Supplier Directory includes an Account Database, and
the Supplier Database tab has options to view Supplier Certificate Orders, and
perform most of functions previously discussed on those orders.

First select a Supplier Database from the drop down box, or a new one either by
typing a path or clicking the square path box to select a Database Directory
using a dialog window.  Click the 'Open Supplier' button, the database will be
opened, the supplier details shown in the yellow box and the Supplier Certificate
Orders list populated with the principal order details, clicking any line will
show extra details in the yellow box.  Certain buttons will be enabled or
disabled depending on each Issue State.

Buttons available are: Check Order, Get Challenges, Order Certificate (same as
Test and Start Challenges above), Collect Certificate, Redistribute (copy to web
server again), Cancel Order (without revoke), Revoke Certificate and Remove
Order (removed from database only), most of which have been described for the
order process earlier.

Revoke an order should generally only be done if the certificate is in public
use and the private key has been compromised.  Revoke means the certificate will
be added to supplier CRL and OCSP databases which are checked by browsers to
prevent compromised certificates being trusted until expiry.

The TSslX509Certs component provides several functions for dealing with accounts
and the database, which relate closely to the buttons on the Supplier Database
tab.  These functions are used by the TSslWSocketServer method OrderCert.


function OpenAccount(const WorkDir: String; CreateNew: Boolean = False): Boolean;

Opens the supplier account in the specified directory, optionally creating a new
account if the directory does not exist or is empty.  For a new account, several
properties are needed: DebugLevel, DomWebSrvIP, LogJson, LogPkeys, SupplierEmail,
SupplierProto, SupplierServer and SupplierTitle. SupplierEmail and SupplierProto
as SuppProtoAcmeV2 and SuppProtoCertCentre and SupplierServer from
GetServerAPIUrl are required, others are optional.  For SuppProtoCertCentre
several more OAuth2 properties for the CertCentre AG account are needed: OAAppUrl,
OAClientId. OAClientSecret, OARedirectUrl, OARefrMinsPrior, OAScope, OATokenUrl,
OAWebSrvIP and OAWebSrvPort, see sample application for more info.

Once the account is opened, the property DomainItems returns an array of
TDomainItems containing the main details of each domain record in the database,
and an event is triggered whenever this changes.

The function will fail if ics-control.db can not be found or the working
directory mismatches the database.


function CloseAccount: Boolean;

Close the account, if open.


function CertReadDomain(const aDomain: String): Boolean;

For an open account, reads all the properties for an X509 SSL certificate with
the Common Name from the database, if found, including one or more subject
alternate names.

The function will fail if the domain has not been saved in the database.


function CertSaveDomain(const aDomain: String): Boolean;

Save or update properties for an X509 SSL certificate with the Common Name to
the database.  There are many possible properties, depending on the type of
certificate being ordered, the supplier, challenge type, etc, all of which are
illustrated in the sample application.  The main properties are: CertCommonName,
SuppCertChallenge as TChallengeType supports ChallFileUNC, ChallFileFtp,
ChallFileSrv, ChallDNS, ChallEmail, ChallAlpnUNC, ChallAlpnSrv, ChallManual,
CertPKeyType as type TSslPrivKeyType typically PrivKeyRsa2048, CertSignDigest as
type TEvpDigest typically Digest_sha256, CertCsrOrigin usually CsrOriginProps,
CertSerNumType usually SerNumRandom, CertOutFmts usually set [OutFmtBudl,
OutFmtP12], DirWellKnown if ChallFileUNC, DirPubWebCert as a path,
PrivKeyPassword, PrivKeyCipher usually PrivKeyEncTripleDES, CertSubAltNames as
multiple subject alternate names if supported by the certificate, CertValidity
in days (usually 365 or 730), SuppCertProduct.

For SuppProtoCertCentre contact and address details are required: CertAddress,
CertContactEmail, CertContactFirst, CertContactLast, CertContactTitle,
CertCountry, CertLocality, CertOrgUnit, CertOrganization, CertPhone,
CertPostCode, CertState.  For commercial certificates, the sample application
provides ProductCA, ProductCertType, ProductDVAuth, ProductFeatures,
ProductMaxSan and ProductQuote, and will show the price of the certificate
with a warning before the product is saved, but once in the database it can
be ordered automatically if the CertCentre AG account has sufficient credit.
CertApprovEmail for email challenge.

Fails if account not opened, if CertCommonName does not match aDomain, if
SupplierProto is not set, or CertSubAltNames is empty.  But otherwise does
not check properties for validity.


function CertCheckDomain(const aDomain: String): Boolean;

For an open account, reads all the properties for an X509 SSL certificate with
the Common Name from the database, if found, including one or more subject
alternate names. If CertCsrOrigin is CsrOriginCSR, the Common Name and SANs
are read from an old CSR file at CertOldCsrFile and the key file from
CertOldPrvKey.  It then checks the Common Name is included in the SANs and adds
it if not, then checks the challenge method and SAN number are supported by
the certificate product. Finally for domain file validation, the component copies
a file to the server Well-Known directory and checks it can be accessed using
each of the SANs domain names.  Any changes are saved to the database.


function CertOrderDomain(const aDomain: String): Boolean;

First calls CertCheckDomain, if that passes continues to place the SSL
certificate order with the supplier, whose processes vary as described in
the ACME and CertCentre AG order processes earlier.  Collection will be
automatic once the challenges succeed.


function CertCollectDomain(const aDomain: String): Boolean;

For an order with issue state challenge pending, checks if all the challenges
have been completed successfully and then collects the order.


function CertCancelDomain(const aDomain: String): Boolean;

For an order with issue state Collected or Installed, will cancel the order
with the supplier, which may result in a refund if done within a reasonable
period.


function CertRevokeDomain(const aDomain: String): Boolean;

For an order with issue state Collected or Installed, will cancel and revoke the
order with the supplier.


function CertRemoveDomain(const aDomain: String): Boolean;

Removes any order from the database, to stop further processing or re-use.


function CertRedistDomain(const aDomain: String): Boolean;

For an order with issue state Collected or Installed, copies the certificate
files to the web server again, if lost.

                       Clear Acme nonce after errors so a fresh nonce is found.
                       Added AutoAccountClose property so account is closed after
                         order is completed or fails and AccountTimeOutMins to
                         close it anyway when idle.  This avoids potential hacking
                         attempts that often follow listing in SSL certificate
                         transparency logs immediately after issue.
                       Improved local web server and REST logging.

                       Expire and remove challenges from the database after 24 hours
                         or a week for manual/email/dns.
May 18, 2020 - V8.64 - Added support for International Domain Names for Applications (IDNA),
                         i.e. using accents and unicode characters in domain names.
                       X509 certificates always have A-Lavels (Punycode ASCII) domain names,
                        never UTF8 or Unicode.   IDNs are converted back to Unicode
                       Fixed bug that stopped new orders after a successful one
                         saying no more today, due to date not being cleared.
                       Allow use of EC keys for ACME account, still don't work yet.
                       Added sanity check for private key type and check private
                          key is generated OK.
                       With automatic order completion don't report errors if the
                         challenges are not actually started, may take several minutes
                         for manual DNS updating.
                       The onChallengeDNS/Email/FTP events have an extra parameter
                         ChlgOK which the application should set once the challenge
                         have been set-up, so the component can stop if necessary.
                         Sorry, this requires application changes.
                       Now storing wildcard and host challenges separately, so they
                         can be used together for the same domain.
                       Fixed several literal typos, sorry.
                       Support tls-alpn-01 challenge for local web server on 443.
                       WebSrvHttp event to check http-01 ChallFileApp well-known
                         challenge without neding to save a file.
                       Avoid possible logging exception with StopDomSrv during destroy.
                       Added testing DNS challenges against public DNS servers.
                       Major restructure of ordering process so that challenges are
                         obtained and locally tested before the Acme order process
                         starts, Acme challenges are valid for seven days, so
                         this allows manual DNS challenges to be set-up and tested
                         later.
                       Implemented SelfSigned function to create certificate from
                         properties, optionally as a CA (for Own CA).
                       Implement AcmeV2OrderCancel to cancel order and revoke order,
                         former useful to remove old challenges (which remain valid
                         for a week or more) so fresh challenges can be tested.
Dec 09, 2020 - V8.65 - Using new SuperObject DateTime methods.
                       Better validation for remote certificate directories.
                       Better logging when waiting for challenges to complete.
                       Remove old challenges when starting new Acme order,
                         but leave fake DNS record.
                       Save local server IP address with domains, and check using
                         correct address, may be different for different orders.
                       Added extra IssStateChallgWaitTest.
                       Close local web server before collecting certificate to stop
                         hacking immediately certificate issued (and listed in
                         certificate transparency log).
                       Builds without AUTO_X509_CERTS, without some functionality.
                       Renamed Ics.Posix.Messages.pas to Ics.Posix.PXMessages.pas.
Mar 23, 2021 - V8.66 - Bad version.
                       When starting local web server, check server IP address still
                         exists or change to 0.0.0.0, may not work if multiple IPs exist.
                       Minor fixes to file challenges, thanks to Oliver Dahlmann.
Sep 22, 2021 - V8.67 - Improved error messages if testing challenge fails.
                       OpenSSL 3.0 makes several old ciphers and digests legacy so default
                         for encrypting PFX/P12 files is now PrivKeyEncAES256 with 3.0
                         unless the legacy DLL is loaded when still PrivKeyEncTripleDES
                         so older versions of Windows can load them.
                       Changed extraction of download PEM bundle so that main certificate
                         does not need to be first in file, log them all, ignore any
                         self signed root certificates.
                       If testing dns-01 challenge fails, rotate to next public server
                         and three retries (previously only happened on timeout).
                       When saving files with private keys, log encryption type used.
                       Another attempt as consistently formatted literals, fewer capitals.
                       Added more certificate output formats, OutFmtPwPem and OutFmtPwP12
                         specify whether to password PEM and P12/PFX private keys. Note
                         Windows always needs passworded P12/PRX files, while Apache web
                         server only accepts PEM files without a password.
                       Allow automatic installation of new certificates to the Windows
                         Certificate Store so they can be used by IIS web sites, by
                         setting output format to OutFmtWinStore.  Note application must
                         have administrator rights to do this.
                       Truncate certificate chain info to 1,000 bytes avoid overloading
                         database INI file.
                       Check new certificate bundles can actually be opened.
Dec 20, 2021 - V8.68 - Added property KeepOldCA set true to keep LA intermediate for
                         expired DST Root CA X3 root in bundles (for old Androids).
                         Keeping it may prevent some clients verifying the chain and
                         SslLabs testing gives a chain warning.
                       HttpRest now allows saving a file, so change Acme terms to do so.
Apr 05, 2022 - V8.69 - Builds on MacOS again, MsSslUtils is Windows only so don't attempt
                         to install certificate into Windows store on Mac.
                       Added unit OverbyteIcsSslHttpOAuth for stuff previously in HttpRest.
                       When revoking certificate, look for bundle file if single file missing.



Pending - more documentation
Pending - keep CertCentre admin details as supplier
