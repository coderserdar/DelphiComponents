History:
Apr 25, 2008 V1.00 AGarrels added first functions UnicodeToAscii, UnicodeToAnsi,
             AnsiToUnicode and IsUsAscii .
May 01, 2008 V1.01 AGarrels added StreamWriteString.
May 02, 2008 V1.02 AGarrels a few optimizations and a bugfix in StreamWriteString.
May 11, 2008 V1.03 USchuster added atoi implementations (moved from several units)
May 15, 2008 V1.04 AGarrels fix in IcsAppendStr made StreamWriteString a function.
May 19, 2008 V1.05 AGarrels added BOM-support to StreamWriteString plus two
             overloads. Made UnicodeString a type alias of WideString in compiler
             versions < COMPILER12 in order to enable use of some conversion
             routines for older compilers as well.
May 19, 2008 V1.06 Don't check actual string codepage but assume UTF-16 Le
             in function StreamWriteString() (temp fix).
Jul 14, 2008 V1.07 atoi improved, should be around 3 times faster.
Jul 17, 2008 V1.08 Added OverbyteIcsTypes to the uses clause and removed
             SysUtils, removed some defines for unsupported old compilers.
             StreamWriteString should work with WideStrings as well with old
             compilers.
Jul 20, 2008 V1.09 Added Utf-8 string functions.
Jul 29, 2008 V1.10 Added parameter "SetCodePage" to UnicodeToAnsi(), defaults
             to "False". Utf-8 functions adjusted accordingly. Does effect
             compiler post RDS2007 only.
Jun 05, 2008 Utf-8 functions modified to take and return AnsiString rather than
             UTF8String.
Aug 11, 2008 CheckUnicodeToAnsi() added. Changed the DefaultFailChar to "?".
Aug 23, 2008 Utf-8 functions modified RawByteString rather than AnsiString.
Aug 27, 2008 Arno Garrels added WideString functions and other stuff.
Sep 11, 2008 Angus added more widestring functions
             No range checking so they all work (IcsFileGetAttrW in particular)
Sep 20, 2008 V1.16 Angus still adding WideString functions
Sep 21, 2008 V1.17 Link RtlCompareUnicodeString() dynamically at run-time
Sep 27, 2008 V1.18 Arno fixed a bug in StringToUtf8.
Sep 28, 2008 V1.19 A. Garrels Moved IsDigit, IsXDigit, XDigit, htoi2 and htoin
             from OverbyteIcsUrl and added overloads. Fixed a bug in
             ConvertCodepage().
Oct 03, 2008 V1.20 A. Garrels moved some double helper functions to this unit.
             Added symbol USE_INLINE that enables inlining.
Oct 23, 2008 V7.21 A. Garrels added IcsStrNextChar, IcsStrPrevChar and
             IcsStrCharLength, see description below. Useful when converting
             a ANSI character stream with known code page to Unicode in
             chunks. Added a PAnsiChar overload to function AnsiToUnicode.
Nov 13, 2008 v7.22 Arno added CharsetDetect, IsUtf8Valid use CharsetDetect.
Dec 05, 2008 v7.23 Arno added function IcsCalcTickDiff.
Apr 18, 2009 V7.24 Arno added a PWideChar overload to UnicodeToAnsi().
May 02, 2009 V7.25 Arno added IcsNextCharIndex().
May 03, 2009 V7.26 Arno added IsUtf8TrailByte and IsLeadChar.
May 14, 2009 V7.27 Arno changed IcsNextCharIndex() to avoid a compiler
             warning in C++ Builder (assertion moved one line up).
             Removed uneccessary overload directives from IcsCharNextUtf8
             and IcsCharPrevUtf8.
May 17, 2009 V7.28 Arno prefixed argument names of various UTF-8 overloads
             by "Utf8" so that C++Builder user know that UTF-8 encoded
             AnsiStrings are expected.
June 4, 2009 V7.29 Angus added IcsExtractLastDir
Jun 22, 2009 V7.30 Angus avoid D2009 error with IcsExtractLastDir
Sep 24, 2009 V7.31 Arno added TIcsIntegerList and IcsBufferToHex.
             Small fix in ConvertCodepage(). Added check for nil in
             IcsCharNextUtf8(). Added global consts CP_UTF16, CP_UTF16Be,
             CP_UTF32 and CP_UTF32Be. New functions IcsBufferToUnicode,
             IcsGetWideCharCount and IcsGetWideChars see comments in interface
             section. Added fast functions to swap byte order: IcsSwap16,
             IcsSwap16Buf, IcsSwap32, IcsSwap32Buf and IcsSwap64Buf.
Dec 15, 2009 V7.32 Arno added typedef PInt64 for CB 2006 and CB2007.
Mar 06, 2010 V7.33 Arno fixed IcsGetWideCharCount, MultiByteToWideChar() does
             not support flag "MB_ERR_INVALID_CHARS" with all code pages.
             Fixed some ugly bugs in UTF-8 helper functions too. Added
             IsUtf8LeadByte() and IcsUtf8Size().
Apr 26, 2010 V7.34 Arno removed some Windows dependencies. Charset conversion
             functions optionally may use GNU iconv library (LGPL) by explicitly
             defining conditional "USE_ICONV".
May 07, 2010 V7.35 Arno added IcsIsSBCSCodepage.
Aug 21, 2010 V7.36 Arno fixed a bug in the UTF-8 constructor of TIcsFileStreamW.
Sep 05, 2010 V7.37 Arno added procedure IcsNameThreadForDebugging
Apr 15, 2011 V7.38 Arno prepared for 64-bit.

Feb 08, 2012 v7.43 Arno - The IcsFileCreateW and IcsFileOpenW functions return a
             THandle in XE2+ now. Same as SysUtils.FileCreate and SysUtils.FileOpen
             in XE2+.
Feb 29, 2012 V7.44 Arno added IcsRandomInt() and IcsCryptGenRandom(), see
             comments at IcsRandomInt's implementation.
Apr 27, 2012 V7.45 Arno added IcsFileUtcModified().

May 12, 2017 V8.47 Added IcsCheckTrueFalse
Jun 23, 2017 V8.49 Fixes for MacOs
                   Added several functions for copying and searching TBytes buffers

Sep 18, 2018 V8.57 Added IcsWireFmtToStrList and IcsStrListToWireFmt converting
                     Wire Format concatenated length prefixed strings to TStrings
                     and vice versa, used by SSL hello.

Jun 19, 2019 V8.62 Added IcsGetLocalTZBiasStr get time zone bias as string, ie -0700.
                   Added Time Zone support for date string conversions, to UTC time with
                      a time zone, and back to local time using a time zone.
                   RFC3339_DateToStr and RFC1123_Date add time zone bias if AddTZ=True, ie -0700.
                   Added RFC3339_DateToUtcStr and RFC1123_UtcDate which convert local
                      time to UTC and format it per RFC3339 with time zone bias.
                   RFC3339_StrToDate and RFC1123_StrToDate now recognise time zone
                      bias and adjust result if UseTZ=True from UTC to local time.

                   Added TypeInfo enumeration sanity check for IcsSetToStr and IcsStrToSet.
Mar 18, 2020 V8.64 Allow IcsGetUTCTime, IcsSetUTCTime, GetIcsFormatSettings to build
                     on MacOS again, they use Windows only APIs.
                   IcsGetTempPath builds on MacOS.
                   IcsGetCompName now Windows only, only used in samples.
                   IcsStrListToWireFmt supports Unicode correctly.
                   IcsWireFmtToStrList checks buffer length valid, added IcsWireFmtToCSV
                   Declare TBytess function parameters as const to avoid reference
                     counting corruption with cast pointers, thanks to Kas Ob for
                     finding this, which caused stack corruption and unexpected
                     errors mainly with 64-bit applications, probably.
                   Added support for International Domain Names for Applications,
                     i.e. using accents and unicode characters in domain names.
                   IcsIDNAToASCII converts a Unicode domain or host name into
                     A-Label (Punycode ASCII) if any characters over x7F, preceding
                     with ACE (ASCII Compatible Encoding) prefix xn--.
                   IcsIDNAToUnicode converts an A-Label (Punycode ASCII) domain or
                     host name into Unicode if any ACE (ASCII Compatible Encoding)
                     prefixes xn-- are found.
                   IcsToASCII and IcsToUnicode are similar but work on simple
                     labels (the nodes in a domain name), uses ACE.
                   IcsPunyEncode and IcsPunyDecode do the actual Unicode conversion
                     to and from A-Label (Punycode ASCII), no ACE.
                   Sample OverbyteIcsBatchDnsLookup has lots of ISN test names.
Dec 17, 2020 V8.65 Builds under Delphi 7 again, no inline.
                   Added some literals to build Json.
                   Added IcsPosEx with compatibility for all compilers.
                   MacOS64 and Linux do not support inline assembler so set PUREPASCAL.
                   Fix TIcsFindList.AddSorted result mismatch with MacOS64.
                   FileSetAttr is windows only, so can not delete read only files on Posix.
                   Lot of minor changes preparing for Linux support, several
                      MACOS changed to POSIX, some TODO functions.
                   Replaced some LongInts with Integer for Posix.
                   Added IcsMakeLongLong to make Int64
                   Corrected RFC1123_StrToDate to accept single digit day of the
                     month, which is illegal but common.
Sep 22, 2021 V8.67 Added overloaded AnsiToUnicode with specified size buffer. used by
                     IcsMoveTBytesToString and some IcsHtmlToStr conversion to resolve
                     problem processing buffer with no terminating null, so extra
                     characters got added beyond buffer end.
                   Added common computer size literals IcsKBYTE, IcsMBYTE, IcsGBYTE.
                   Added IcsStringBuild class moved from OverbyteIcsBlacklist,
                     works on all compilers.
                   Added IcsGetShellPath based on GetCommonAppDataFolder in
                     OverbyteIcsIniFiles.
                   Added IcsDirExists to replace DirExists in OverbyteIcsFtpSrv.
                   Moved Base64Encode/Base64Decode here from OverbyteIcsMimeUtils.
                   Moved IcsBase64UrlDecode, IcsBase64UrlEncode/A and IcsJsonPair
                     here from OverbyteIcsSslJose to ease circular referencing.
                   IcsBase64UrlEncodeA avoid string conversions should be used
                     for encoding binary fields with nulls.
                   Added IcsBase64UrlDecodeA avoid string conversions should be
                     used for decoding binary fields with nulls.
Dec 13, 2021 V8.68 Trying to keep C++ happy.
                   Moved IcsFileInUse and IcsTruncateFile here from OverbyteIcsCopy.
May 04, 2022 V8.69 Split IcsMoveStringToTBytes (no code page) into two versions,
                     one for Unicode String, one for AnsiString.

      error.  The AllowUnassigned flag is used in [NAMEPREP].
   3. If the UseSTD3ASCIIRules flag is set, then perform these checks:
     (a) Verify the absence of non-LDH ASCII code points; that is, the
         absence of 0..2C, 2E..2F, 3A..40, 5B..60, and 7B..7F.
     (b) Verify the absence of leading and trailing hyphen-minus; that
         is, the absence of U+002D at the beginning and end of the sequence.
   4. If the sequence contains any code points outside the ASCII range
      (0..7F) then proceed to step 5, otherwise skip to step 8.
   5. Verify that the sequence does NOT begin with the ACE prefix.
   6. Encode the sequence using the encoding algorithm in [PUNYCODE] and
      fail if there is an error.
   7. Prepend the ACE prefix.
   8. Verify that the number of code points is in the range 1 to 63 inclusive.  }

{ RFC 3490 ToUnicode are a sequence of code points, the
   AllowUnassigned flag, and the UseSTD3ASCIIRules flag.  The output of
   ToUnicode is always a sequence of Unicode code points.
   1. If all code points in the sequence are in the ASCII range (0..7F)
      then skip to step 3.
   2. Perform the steps specified in [NAMEPREP] and fail if there is an
      error.  (If step 3 of ToASCII is also performed here, it will not
      affect the overall behavior of ToUnicode, but it is not
      necessary.)  The AllowUnassigned flag is used in [NAMEPREP].
   3. Verify that the sequence begins with the ACE prefix, and save a
      copy of the sequence.
   4. Remove the ACE prefix.
   5. Decode the sequence using the decoding algorithm in [PUNYCODE] and
      fail if there is an error.  Save a copy of the result of this step.
   6. Apply ToASCII.
   7. Verify that the result of step 6 matches the saved copy from step
      3, using a case-insensitive ASCII comparison.
   8. Return the saved copy from step 5.  }
