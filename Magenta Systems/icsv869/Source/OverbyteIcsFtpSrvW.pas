History:
If not otherwise noted, changes are by Francois Piette
Apr 29, 1998  V0.90 released for beta testing.
May 01, 1998  V0.92 Adapted for Delphi 1.0
May 03, 1998  V0.93 Adapted for Delphi 2.0 and C++Builder
May 04, 1998  V0.94 Use '/' or '\' as path delimiter. Expose only '/' to the
              outside. Stripped any telnet options (IE send two !). Handled
              absolute path. Implemented SIZE and REST commands.
              Added support for UNC (not finished !)
May 06, 1998  V0.95 Corrected spurious 226 message on PASV mode STOR.
              Made GetInteger retunrs a LongInt.
              Use a LongInt for N in CommandPORT (needed for 16 bits)
              Added slash substitution in BuildFilePath command.
Jul 09, 1998  V1.00 Adapted for Delphi 4, removed beta status.
Jul 21, 1998  V1.01 Added OnValidateDele event
              Changed function to get file size (do not open the file)
Feb 14, 1999  V1.02 Replaced straight winsock call by indirect calls thru
              wsocket (this provide runtime link to winsock DLL).
Mar 06, 1999  V1.03 Added code from  Plegge, Steve <jsp@nciinc.com> to add
              APPE, XMKD, KRMD and STRU commands support.
Jul 24, 1999  V1.04 Replaced msgStorDisabled value from '500 Cannot STOR.' to
              '501 Permission Denied' because CuteFTP doesn't like error 500.
              Suggested by Cedric Veilleux <webmaster@smashweb.com>.
Aug 20, 1999  V1.05 Added compile time options. Revised for BCB4.
              Added Addr property to select interface in multihomed computers.
Oct 02, 1999  V1.06 Added OnValidateRnFr and OnValidateRnTo events.
              Initialized Allowed variable to TRUE before triggerValidateDele.
Nov 24, 1999  V1.07 Added MTDM support. Thanks to Bruce Christensen
              <bkc51831234@hotmail.com> for his code.
Jan 24, 2000  V1.08 Patch IE5 bug in file names. Thanks to <dsnake@infonie.fr>
Jun 08, 2000  V1.09 Added 'A N' type for type command for AIX systems.
Oct 25, 2000  V1.10 Exposed list of clients thru Client[] property.
Oct 29, 2000  V1.11 Added IsClient() method.
              Implemented OnValidateRmd event.
Nov 01, 2000  V1.12 Implemented proposals from Carl@Smotricz.com:
              (1) support for MODE command, but only the default do-nothing
              option S. (2) binding the data socket to the local host address
              and port 20 ('ftp-data'). (3) detection of failure to open the
              data connection for STOR or RETR.
              Added option wsoNoReceiveLoop to sockets. See comments in TWSocket
              about this option. Help in very fast LAN.
Nov 11, 2000  V1.13 Checked for DOS attack. Close connection when buffer
              overflow occured. Thanks to Lester <les@lester.co.uk> for finding
              this security hole.
Jun 18, 2001  V1.14 Fixed file left open when storing and client broken data
              connection. Thanks to Davie <smatters@smatters.com>
Jul 27, 2001  V1.15 I fixed a race condition between WMFtpSrvClientClosed and
              WMFtpSrvCloseData found by Matthew Comb <matt@filesafe.co.nz> who
              worked with Davie <smatters@smatters.com>. Now WMFtpSrvCloseData
              receive Client in LParam and check if client is still in client
              list.
              Fixed a but with resumed put. Thanks Yvan Turkan iturcan@gamo.sk !
              Added a procedure to disconnect a single client.
              Changed all Exception by FtpServerException.
              Changed all "Error" by "AError" to avoid conflict with global var.
              Added Client.ID property to uniquely indentify the client. Pass
              this ID along with all posted messages and verify if the correct
              client still exists when message is processed.
Jul 30, 2001  V1.16 Added same check as above for WMFtpSrvCloseData.
Sep 09, 2001  V1.17 Eric Pascual <e.pascual@cstb.fr> added Store Unique (STOU)
              command.
Feb 26, 2002  V1.18 Fastream Technologies (http://www.fastream.com) found a bug
              in Disconnect and DisconnectAll which prevented data connection
              to be closed and client component to be destroyed.
Jul 06, 2002  V1.19 Fastream Technologies (http://www.fastream.com) fixed
              CommandXPWD and CommandPWD to make the path in answer as
              "/c:/windows" instead of "c:/windows" which is more compatible
              with the UNIX standard that most clients expect.
Sep 16, 2002  V1.20 Added OnValidateSize event.
              Allowed "REST 0" as a valid command.
Sep 17, 2002  V1.21 Sven Schmidts <sven.schmidts@nusec.de> added partional FEAT
              command, must extended, because I doesn't know what commands are
              special-featured.
Oct 26, 2002  V1.22 Introduced OnBuildFilePath to allow component use to change
              the file path on the fly.
              Thanks to Serge Chelli <serge@aceinformatique.com> who proposed
              this change.
Nov 01, 2002  V1.23 When client request passive mode, select a port from a
              range of ports instead of letting the OS choose one. This ease the
              use of a FTP server behind a firewall. Passive mode transferts
              will use port in the specified range.
              Also implemented fixed IP for passive mode.
              Thanks to Ian Tuck <ituck@noglobalborders.com> for code base.
Nov 06, 2002  V1.24 Added definition for PBoolean which is missing in some
              older Delphi version and in BCB.
Nov 11, 2002  V1.25 Revised for Delphi 1
Jan 26, 2003  V1.26 ByteCount fix. Thanks to wilfried@mestdagh.biz and
              fastream@fastream.com for the fix.
Sep 15, 2003  V1.27 Added ICSDEF feature to the source code. Thanks to Marco
              van de Voort <marcov@stack.nl> for his help.
Nov 01, 2003  V1.28 Corrected FormatUnixDirEntry for files greater than 2GB.
Dec 15, 2003  V1.29 Changed ClientRetrSessionConnected to check if file exists
              to avoid TStream exception opening a non existant file.
Jan 15, 2004  V1.30 Made BuildFilePath virtual.
Feb 16, 2004  V1.31 Andreas Mueller <Amueller@Nord-Vision.de> updated
              CommandRNFR and CommandRNTO to handle directories.
Feb 24, 2004  V1.32 Wilfried changed Close by Shutdown(1) in WMFtpSrvCloseData.
Mar 06, 2004  V1.33 Added DirectoryExists function for Delphi below V5
May 26, 2004  V1.34 Added support for hidden files. Thanks to Martin Koberstein
              <MKoberstein@nord-vision.de>.
Jun 07, 2004  V1.35 Fixed DirExists to "see" hidden directories. This
              permit deletion of hidden directories
Jun 08, 2004  V1.36 Removed DirectoryExists function and used DirExists instead.
Jul 23, 2004  V1.37 Added type keyword to "TFtpString = type String;"
Aug 6, 2004   V1.38 Angus Robertson, angus@magsys.co.uk added new Options property
              added MDTM YYYYMMDDHHMMSS support (set file mod date)
              added MLST and MLSD commands for better file listings
              CWD now returns 550 if new directory does not exist and Options=ftpsCWDCheck
              changing to a higher level directory than HomeDir is blocked if Options=ftpsCdupHome
              corrected DirExists to strip trailing backslash so it works
Aug 19, 2004  V1.39 Angus Robertson, corrected Options=ftpsCWDCheck to allow
              root (c:\)
              Options passed to Client as ftpCwdCheck, ftpCdupHome so they
              can be changed per client
              MDTM checks logged-in, new trigger before changing file time stamp
              Added MFMT modify file modification time (same as
              MDTM YYYYMMDDHHMMSS but draft RFC'd)
              (not yet supporting MFCT create time or MFF file facts commands)
              Added MD5 command which returns hash of file content to allow
              corruption check
              (not yet supporting MMD5 multiple file or XMD5 file range commands)
Sep 08, 2004 V1.40 MD5 has been renamed to IcsMD5
Oct 20, 2004 V1.41 Angus Robertson, MLSD command failed in passive mode
Mar 11, 2005 V1.42 Marco van de Voort <marcov@stack.nl> updated the component
             to be compatible with NOFORMS concept.
             He implemented FtpSrvAllocateHWnd and FtpSrvDeallocateHWnd based
             on TWSocket versions.
             Angus Robertson, using ftpCwdCheck and ftpcUNC allow CWD to change
             to root
Sept 6, 2005 V1.43 64-bit support for Delphi 6 and later, for transfers larger
             than 2 gigs, added error handling for failed seeks and TStream issues
             by Angus Robertson, angus@magsys.co.uk
Oct 21, 2005 V1.44 Arno Garrels added SSL features.
Dec 29, 2005 V1.45 Peter Feldbaumer feldbaumer@feldtech.com fixed excessive
             226-response for cancelled passive data-connections. He also
             fixed ByteCount handling, unified passive data-connection-setup.
Dec 30, 2005 V1.46 Arno Garrels added IcsLogger.
Jan 18, 2006 V1.47 TLS/SSL related changes.
Aug 6, 2006  V1.48 using GetWinsockErr in wsocket to give consistent textual and
             numeric winsock errors, by Angus (some constant literals changed from %d to %s)
             wsocket fix for 64-bit transfers with range checking enabled
             for address in use error, report port in proper decimal
             SSL check Self = TSslFtpServerW before accessing SSL properties (Arno)
Aug 31, 2006 V1.49 A.Garrels reworked 64-bit streams support.
Sep 20, 2006 V1.50 A.Garrels implemented smarter MD5 calculation.
             How it works: On new uploads new option ftpsCalcMD5OnTheFly forces
             calculation of the MD5 sum in chunks in ClientStorDataAvailable.
             New property Md5UseThreadFileSize determines whether the checksum
             is calculated in a blocking manner or inside a worker thread
             when FTP command MD5 is processed. Therefore I introduced a new
             ProcessingThread in TFtpCtrlSocketW that may be used for any
             lengthy processing inside the component.
             New event OnMD5Calculated triggers either when the internal MD5
             calculation finished or when the sum needs to be updated, an
             empty parameter Md5Sum signals to delete a possibly cached entry
             except the file has been renamed.
Oct 27, 2006 V1.51 A.Garrels made the command table a dynamic array. Some
             improvements with PasvIpAddr: New options ftpsNoPasvIpAddrInLan
             and ftpsNoPasvIpAddrSameSubnet. New event OnPasvIpAddr.
Dec 05, 2006 Fixed FreeCurrentPasvPort
May 09, 2007 V1.52 changes by A.Garrels. Added two new events (sponsored by
             Fastream Technologies). OnEnterSecurityContext and
             OnLeaveSecurityContext make it possible to switch Windows'
             security context to the context of the logged client. New option
             ftpsHidePhysicalPath. Changed/fixed the STOU command. Fixed
             some security issues: If ftpCdUphome is in the options it's no
             longer possible to change, list, remove, rename or create
             directories above the home directory. Removed trailing
             slash from response-paths except upon root directories.
             Note: ftpsHidePhysicalPath is ignored unless ftpsCdUphome is also
             set.
June 11, 2007 V1.53 MDTM command failed with a directory name.
             Andreas Haas <andreas.haas@ops.de>
             Angus Robertson, MFMT command now supports millisecs when updating
             file time stamp (because MFMD command already returned millisecs)
             Note: sysutils FileAge functions used only supports round seconds
             Angus Robertson, Passive IP 0.0.0.0 now raises exception.
04 Dec 2007 V1.54 added more FEAT extensions, by Angus Robertson, angus@magsys.co.uk
               Note: some FEATs only reported if new events are created
             added support for One Time Passwords (aka S/Key), otp-md5, otp-md4 and otp-sha1,
               see RFC2289, uses new events OnOtpMethodEvent and OnOtpGetPasswordEvent
               (see OverbyteIcsFtpServ1 demo for OTP usage, ignore events for no OTP)
             added timeouts to close sockets on inactivity, new properties
               TimeoutSecsLogin (default 60 seconds), TimeoutSecsIdle (300) and
               TimeoutSecsXfer (900, same as IIS/4) before client is closed with
               421 answer. Note timeout is checked using a timer event once every
               five seconds so not second accurate. This event could be used for other jobs.
               Uses new event OnTimeout which can reset the timeout if needed
             added Clnt command to accept client information, calls new event
                onClntStr and sets Client.ClntStr
             added Allo command to return disk space allocation (before upload)
               checks and returns space on user's volume, but only says OK if
               AlloExtraSpace (default 1 Byte) still left as well, calls OnValidateAllo
               which may check space allocated for a specific account
             added Comb command to allow multiple upload files to be combined,
               used new event onCombine (where the actual file handling should be added)
             added Site Pswd command to change the account password, uses new
               event onSitePswd where the old and new passwords may be parsed
             added Site Exec command to execute a progam, uses new event
               onSiteExec which can decide whether the program should be run, and do it
             added Site Index command to generate a recusive directory and file name
               listing (no date or size) on the control channel, supported by Serv-U
             added Site Zone command to return the server time zone difference from
               UTC (GMT) which the client may use to adjust file listing time stamps
             added SiteMsg command to accept a message to the server, uses
               new event onSiteMsg
             added Site Dmlsd command, similar to MLSD but optional argument
               -SUBDIRS or -R for recursive directories, the path may be quoted if
               it includes spaces, the listing file names includes paths
             added Site Cmlsd command, similar to Site Dmlsd but uses control channel
               to avoid lots of small data channels sessions
             NOTE: Site Dmlsd and SiteCmlsd are new commands supported only by ICS
                FTP Server and may be disabled by removing the option ftpsSiteXmlsd
             the LIST, NLST, MLSD commands now also support -R for recursive
               sub-directores and a quoted file name
             recursive subdirectories are processsed in a thread unless option
                ftpsThreadRecurDirs is removed, ftpsThreadAllDirs similarly for all lists
             added Xcrc command to generate hash optional start and end positions,
               uses new events OnCalculateCrc and OnCrcCalculated, uses
               MD5UseThreadFileSize to check if a thread is used
             added Xmd5 command to generate hash optional start and end positions,
               used existing events OnCalculateMd5 and OnMd5Calculated
             added Mode Z and Opts commands and support for ZLIB compression if
                option ftpsModeZCompress set for server and ftpModeZCompress not disabled
                for client, ZlibMinLevel (1) and ZlibMaxLevel (9) properties restrict
                min and max compress stategies (max takes longer), ZlibNoCompExt is
                list of file extensions which compress with level 0 means no compress,
                defaults to '.zip;.rar;.7z;.cab;.lzh;.gz;.avi;.wmv;.mpg;.mp3;.jpg;.png;',
                ZlibWorkDir runtime property is path where temporary ZLIB files are written
                  defaults to '(systmppath)\icsftpsrv\'
                ZlinMinSpace property is minimum space on ZlibWorkDir for Mode Z to
                  be allowed, defaults to 50MByte
             added onDisplay event for server to log special information
             now reporting upload and download performance via OnDisplay event
             added various Client counters that may be used in the events to track
               server and account usage and performance, TotGetBytes and TotPutBytes
               are cumulative totals for the client which should be read in
               onClientDisconnect, SessStartTick is when client started, SessIdInfo
               may be set with client account info during logon, ReqStartTick is when
               the last request started and ReqDurMilliSecs is set to it's duration
               when the request finishes, XferStartTick is when an upload or download
               connected and starting sending data.
               Note: OverbyteIcsFtpSrvT has new functions for tick processing and timing
             moved building file directory functions to OverbyteIcsFtpSrvC so they
               can be used from client thread
             moved slash/backslash functions to OverbyteIcsFtpSrvT
             using Arno's TBufferedFileStream for improved performance
09 Dec 2007 V1.55 mode z bug fix for resumed transfers, by Angus Robertson, angus@magsys.co.uk
             added ftpsModeZNoResume option to disable resume while in Mode Z
             added ZlibMaxSize property to restrict maximum size of file that can compressed
             added callback in zlib funcs to update LastTick
06 Jan 2008 V1.56 corrected timer interval, timeout improvements
             passive port pool now issues incrementing ports instead of the sames ones
03 Mar 2008 V1.57 added SrvFileModeRead and SrvFileModeWrite as public so share locking
               can be changed, use SrvFileModeRead for MD5SUM (not locked)
            ensure file stream closed if session terminates unexpectedly
Apr 15, 2008 V1.58 A. Garrels, Unicode changes. Changed type of RcvBuf to
             PAnsiChar, corrected line indents.
Apr 25, 2008 V1.59 Removed checks for faVolumeID.
May 01, 2008 V1.60 A.Garrels added new functions DataStreamWriteString and
             DataStreamReadString.
Mar 24, 2008 V6.01 Bumped version number to 6.01
             Francois Piette made some changes to prepare code for Unicode.
Jun 25, 2008 V6.02 A. Garrels SSL code merged.
Apr 14, 2008 V6.03 A. Garrels, some Unicode related changes, basic features
             do work now. Receive buffer type-change from PChar to PAnsiChar.
             Check the various DataAvailableEvents. Fixed a bug in function
             GetInteger().
Apr 22, 2008 Some more Unicode related changes.
May 01, 2008 V6.04 A. Garrels - call new function DataStreamWriteString in
             TFtpServerW.BuildDirectory.
May 12, 2008 v6.05 A. Garrels changed call of GetTempPath in constructor.
             Some type changes from String to AnsiString of published properties.
             Added Setters and Getters for those properties since current
             compiler is not able to handle AnsiString properties correctly.
Jul 11, 2008 V6.03 Angus fixed 'Unicode' bug introduced in V6.01 that stopped PORT command working
             (Just the change log from v6 added here and minor cosmetic changes
              to keep both verions in sync, this issue was already fixed in v7)
Jul 13, 2008 V6.04 Revised socket names used for debugging purpose
                   Added ListenBackLog property
Jul 13, 2008 V6.04 Made Client ReadCount a public property
Aug 04, 2008 V6.07 A. Garrels - CommandAUTH TLS sent Unicode response.
             Removed some getter and setters, they are no longer needed.
Aug 11, 2008 V6.08 A. Garrels - Type AnsiString rolled back to String.
Sep 21, 2008 V6.11 Arno removed some old compiler switches (CBuilder compat.)
Nov 6, 2008  V7.00 Angus component now uses TSocketServer to accept connections
             Client code from OverbyteFtpSrvC now in this unit
             Removed conditional code for obsolete compilers, D7 minimum
             Added more public client variables for account information
             Increased DefaultRcvSize to 16384 from 2048 for performance
             Fixed exception with threaded MD5Sum progress
             Client.Id is now allocated by TSocketServer
Nov 8, 2008  V7.01 Angus added new commands HOST, REIN, LANG and OPTS UTF8 ON/OFF
               (HOST is supported by Microsoft IIS/7 in Windows 2008)
               HOST domain allows multiple domains on the same IP address (like HTTP)
               REINialise reverts the control channel to just connected with no logon
             Added UTF8 and CodePage support, defaults to ANSI mode for compatibility
             Added ftpsEnableUtf8 and ftpsDefaultUtf8On to Options but
                ftpsDefaultUtf8On should generally not be set, otherwise the client
                is expected to be using UTF8 (FileZilla Server default to on!)
             Note UTF8 only supports full Unicode with D2009, otherwise an ANSI CodePage
             Added new commands XCMLSD and XDMLSD same as SITE CMLSD and DMLSD
Nov 14, 2008 V7.02 Arno fixed a few thread issues. And reworked UTF-8 support.
             Angus ensure BuildDirectory adds errors to directory stream in UTF-8
             default options for ftpsCwdCheck and ftpsCdupHome
===================================================================================
Nov 19, 2008 V7.02W wide version TFtpServerW
             Split to support WideStrings with Delphi 2007 and earlier, changes
             kept in step with original version.
Nov 21, 2008 V7.03 Angus fixed TriggerSendAnswer/AnswerToClient did not allow answer
                to be changed, raw protocol no longer available as public
Nov 21, 2008 V7.04 Arno completed V7.03, it did not compile in D2009,
             allow C++ Builder.
Nov 22, 2008 V7.05 Arno fixed the FEAT response, rfc2389 says that each feature
             line in the feature-listing begins with a single space. But in the
             ICS FTP server a feature line in the listing began with two spaces
             which prevented some clients from seeing the features.
Mar 17, 2009 V7.06 Angus added MaxAttempts property to limit failed login attempts
             (default 12) and delays the failed password answer by about five seconds
             after a third of the failed attempts have been exceeded.
             This feature should be combined with an IP black list to
             stop new connections for failed logins (one hacker tried 250,000
             passwords over 36 hours on one of my FTP servers)
Apr 16, 2009 V7.07 Angus MD5 and CRC use buffered stream
             Clean-up MD5 on the fly
             Assume STREAM64, USE_BUFFERED_STREAM, USE_MODEZ
May 17, 2009 V7.08 Angus renamed FileMD5ThreadOnProgress to UpdateThreadProgress since
                used for various functions other than md5 and made public
             UpdateTheadProgress called by Client.BuildDirList so session does not timeout
                 indexing large directories and can be aborted
             Rename Client.BuildDirectory to BuildDirList to avoid confusion with
                Server.BuildDirectory, made virtual, removed Path no longer used and
                return total files listed, and log number of files listed
             Added OnAddVirtFiles event called from BuildDirList which allows extra virtual
                directories or files to be added to directory listings
             Fixed bug in Server.BuildDirectory that meant BuildFilePath was bypassed for a
                blank directory argument which prevented virtual directories working
             Fixed bugs in CommandChangeDir and CommandALLO that meant virtual directories not
                supported because BuildFilePath was not called when checking directory
             IsPathAllowed now calls BuildFilePath event which may validate if a virtual
                directory is allowed by returning non-blank
             FormatResponsePath also calls BuildFilePath to convert translated virtual
                path back to original path in home directory, so it can be removed
             TriggerLang now calls correct event handler
June 04, 2009 V7.09 Angus called TriggerMd5Calculated when changing file date/time
             default for TimeoutSecsXfer reduced from 900 to 60 secs and only aborts
                 data channel not control channel, it must be shorter than TimeoutSecsIdle
             SessIdInfo add client numeric id to identify separate sessions from same IP
Sept 03, 2009 V7.10 Arno exchanged TThread.Resume by TThread.Start for D2010 and later
Dec  15, 2009 V7.11 Arno added type TFtpSrvCommandTable to make C++Builder happy.
June 10, 2010 V7.12 Angus added bandwidth throttling using TCustomThrottledWSocket
              Set BandwidthLimit property to maximum bytes server wide, for
              specific clients set CBandwidthLimit in a client connect event
              (requires BUILTIN_THROTTLE to be defined in project options or
              enabled OverbyteIcsDefs.inc)
Sep 05, 2010 V7.13 Arno renamed conditional defines EXPERIMENTAL_THROTTLE and
             EXPERIMENTAL_TIMEOUT to BUILTIN_THROTTLE and BUILTIN_TIMEOUT.
Sept 09, 2010 Angus fixed bad code in V7.12 that stopped Unicode file names working
Oct 12, 2010 V7.14 Arno published OnBgException from underlaying server socket.
Nov 08, 2010 V7.15 Arno improved final exception handling, more details
             in OverbyteIcsWndControl.pas (V1.14 comments).
Feb 7,  2010 V7.16 Angus ensure control channel is correctly BandwidthLimited
May 21, 2011 V7.17 Arno ensure CommandAUTH resets the SSL prot-level correctly.
Aug 8,  2011 V7.19 Angus added client SndBufSize and RcvBufSize to set data socket
             buffers sizes for better performance, set to 32K to double speeds
May 2012 - V8.00 - Arno added FireMonkey cross platform support with POSIX/MacOS
                   also IPv6 support, include files now in sub-directory
                   New SocketFamily property (sfAny, sfAnyIPv4, sfAnyIPv6, sfIPv4, sfIPv6)
                   New MultiListenSockets property to add extra listening sockets,
                     each with Addr/Port/SocketFamily/FtpSslTypes properties
                     in events check MultiListenIndex, -1 is main socket, >=0 is
                     index into MultiListenSockets[] for socket raising event
Aug 13, 2012 V8.01 Angus ensure SSL not enabled by default, corrected MultiListen
                   Arno added TSslFtpWSocketMultiListenItem with FtpSslTypes
                     for each MultiListen socket
Jul 01, 2013 V8.02 Arno fixed an exception raised in ClientStorSessionClosed()
                   when an upload was aborted.
Jun 02, 2013 V8.03 Arno fixed a bug in TClientProcessingThread (thread-safety).
Jun 24, 2013 V8.04 Angus added new Options of ftpsCompressDirs defaults false
                   ftpsThreadRecurDirs default false due to rare thread bug
                   Skip using thread in zmode if level=Z_NO_COMPRESSION and
                      size less than one meg since really a straight stream copy
Dec 09, 2014 V8.05 - Angus added SslHandshakeRespMsg for better error handling
Feb 23, 2016 V8.06 - Angus renamed TBufferedFileStream to TIcsBufferedFileStream
Nov 09 2016  V8.37 - Added ExclusiveAddr property to stop other applications listening on same socket
                     Added extended exception information, set SocketErrs = wsErrFriendly for
                       some more friendly messages (without error numbers)
Aug 25, 2017 V8.50 - Angus stopped LIST/RETV using ..\..\..\ (already stopped for CWD)
Mar 8, 2019  V8.60 - Version and copyright dates only.
Nov 6, 2019  V8.63 - ftpsNoPasvIpAddrInLan and ftpsNoPasvIpAddrSameSubnet options
                       now work correctly to present local passive IP address on
                       LAN rather than PassIpAddr which is usually external address.
                     Logging various IP addresses for PASV command for debugging.
                     New IcsHosts property which allows multiple hosts to be
                       specified, each with one or two IP addresses and non-SSL and
                       SSL port bindings, SSL certificates and private key, SSL
                       context and security level.
                     If IcsHosts is specified, TSslWSocketServer ignores existing
                       bindings and SSLContext, and creates new bindings and
                       initialises an SSL context for each host checking and reporting
                       all certificates.
                     Allow SSL certificates to be ordered and installed automatically
                       by RecheckSslCerts if SslCertAutoOrder=True and so specified in
                       IcsHosts, if a TSslX509Certs component is attached and a
                       certificate supplier account has been created (by the
                       OverbyteIcsX509CertsTst sample application).
                     New IcsLoadFtpServerWFromIni function that reads server settings
                       from INI file, IcsHosts can be read using IcsLoadIcsHostsFromIni. 
                     When using IcsHosts, FtpSslTypes is set automatically to Implicit
                       if an SSL port is specified or Explicit if AuthSslCmd is true.
May 01, 2020 V8.64 - Added TFtpOptions ftpsAuthForceSsl which require SSL/TLS for
                       LOGIN so no clear credentials allowed.  May also be set using
                       IcsHosts with AuthForceSsl=True for specific Hosts only.
                       Failure gives '533 USER requires a secure connection'.
                     Better error handling when all passive ports are being used.
                     Fixed a range error with passive connections if range checking
                       was enabled, option ftpsNoPasvIpAddrSameSubnet and adaptors
                       had IPv6 addresses.
Dec 17, 2020 V8.65 - Only increase TCP buffer size, don't reduce it below default
                       of 64K, generally better to let Windows TCP autotuning set size.
                      Note some V.63 changes here for IcsHosts were missed from
                        TSslFtpServer so left some bugs in that version.
                      TFtpCtrlSocketW now descends from TSslWSocketClient so inherited
                        functions work properly like SSL Server Name Identifier to
                        select the correct IcsHost for explicit connections if the
                        FTP client sends SNI as the ICS does.  Moral, don't test SNI
                        with wildcard certificates.
                      Starting SSL using AUTH command now attempts to find the
                        correct IcsHost using Host name (if available).
                     Builds without SSL again.
Feb 15, 2021 V8.66   Removed checks for SSLv2.
May 24, 2021 V8.67   Replaced Stream.Seek with Stream.Position.
Apr 13, 2022 V8.69 - Fixed bug in V8.65 that meant Implicit SSL only worked when
                       using IcsHosts so was not backward compatible with old apps.
                     Added OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) support using the TOcspHttp
                       component to confirm server SSL/TLS certificates are legitimate and not
                       revoked for security reasons (which (Let's Encrypt did with two days
                       notice on 28 Jan 2022).  The certificate OSCP response is also stapled
                       to the initial SSL/TLS HELO handshake and sent to the client to avoid
                       it needing to lookup OCSP using HTTP itself. OCSP responses are cached
                       and saved to a file for reloading later, but are refreshed every time
                       the certificate is validated, at least once a day. The server property
                       OcspSrvStapling=True enables OCSP checks and stapling only with
                       AUTO_X509_CERTS define since it adds extra HTTP client code. A revoked
                       certificate will be auto ordered.


Angus pending -
CRC on the fly
MD5 on the fly for downloads if not cached already
test app - cache zlib files and CRCs and lock updates

Known Issue (V8.04 Angus)
On some processors only (multi-core Xeon?), using the XDMLSD -R command with a root
directory in passive mode and a thread for ftpsThreadRecurDirs or zmode compression
causes output to be randomly lost, raising an exception in the thread.  The issue is
probably memory corruption, but can not trace the reason.  V8.04 mitigates this bug
by disabling ftpsThreadRecurDirs and ftpsCompressDirs compression for directories and
not using a thread if no compression needed (note in zmode a ZLIB must still be
called but does not actually compress the file).

              If you use Delphi 7 and later, you may want to disable warnings
              for unsage type, unsafe code and unsafe typecast in the project
              options. Those warning are intended for .NET programs. You may
              also want to turn off deprecated symbol and platform symbol
              warnings.
