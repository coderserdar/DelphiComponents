TIcsFileCopyW allows indexing, copying and deleting of multiple file
directories, using a single function call.  The component handles listing
source and destination files, and comparing them to avoid unnecessary
transfers, selection using a file mask, deletion of old files, delete after
copy, safe copy (to avoid partial files), and zip before copying or unzip
after copy.  A progress event provides various levels of information for
logging or display, depending upon application requirements, and allows
copying to be cancelled. The component is equally useful for copying single
files or entire volumes with hundreds of thousands of files, and provides
'sync files' functionality making it ideal for backups, only copying changed
files and deleting old target files.

For zip functionality, requires Kevin Boylan's TVCLZip component from
http://www.vclzip.net/, if you purchase this component you will need to
define the include OverbyteVclZip, see below.


Main functions:

BuildDirList2 - build file directory, not sorted, date range selection
BuildDirList - build file directory, not sorted
GetDirList - build file directory, sorted
DispLocFiles - build formatted file directory, sorted
SelectCopyFileList - select files to copy by comparing source and target directories
SelCopyFiles - select and copy multiple files, optionally multiple directories
SelectFiles - select multiple files only
CopyFiles - copy multiple files only
DeleteFiles - delete multiple files
DeleteEmptyDirs - delete empty directories
CopyOneFile - copy single file
Cancel - cancel copying


All these functions make use of file directories comprising dynamic arrays
of TIcsFDirRecW.  These arrays may be used in applications, where individual
access to files is required.

14 Aug 2005  - added network connection to a remote system with a logon (before copying files)
                  RemoteName is UNC name, LocalName is mapped drive, UserName and Password

22 Sep 2008  - 3.0 - Unicode vesion unit renamed MagentaCopyW with TIcsFileCopyW
               support Unicode file listing and copying with Delphi 2007 and earlier
               increased size of initial TFileRecs array from 1000 to 5000 or 25000
                 if subdirs to avoid too many resizes causing copying of data
               FmtFileDirListW builds listing with stream
               DeleteEmptyDirs takes UStringArray argument for widestrings, not StringList
               new SrcDirUList and TarDirUList properties as UStringArray to set Unicode file dirs
18 Nov 2008  - 3.1 - fixed zipping for Unicode changes, but still VCLZip 3
               FmtFileDirListW, FmtFileDirW now Unicode, but probably D2007 or later due to WideFormat

               Ignore File Extensions now minimum 2 characters instead of 4
7 Apr 2009   - 3.2 - made GetMaskedName Unicode, but internally still Ansi since no WideFormatDateTime in D2007
16 Feb 2011  - 3.7 - list and copy empty directories.  Directory functions have a ListDirs parameter,
               TIcsFileCopyW has a new EmptyDirs property, directory attributes should be copied

               added MultiThreaded property to stop Application.ProceessMessages being called
11 Aug 2011  - 3.7 - fix copying into new empty directory instead of next existing directory
20 Oct 2011  - 3.8 - most file sizes now reported in Kbytes. Mbytes, Gbytes instead of bytes
               added explict file name length errors (max 255 + drive/path)
24 Aug 2012 - 4.0 - updated to support ICS V8 with IPv6
11 Jun 2013 - 4.1 - added IgnorePaths to SelectCopyFileList and TIcsFileCopyW to ignore files where source
                 has specific partial path, list is c:\temp;c:\temp2\;c:\temp3\;etc, or destination for
                 deletion matches partial path
              added Wow64RedirDisable property for Win64 allow all files to be copied correctly from Win32
              added new ProgressEvent which passes TCopyProgress record updated for progress of
                  current file and session including total bytes copied allowing percentage progress display
              using TIcsStringBuild to build listings instead of TMemoryStream
              when checking copy, use TIcsStringBuild for improved listing performance
11 May 2015 - 4.2 - TSslCertCheck, SslCertCheckStrings gone
6 Mar 2017 - 4.6 - changed TULargeInteger to ULARGE_INTEGER to keep modern compilers happy
22 Mar 2019 - V8.60 - Adapted for main ICS packages and FMX support.
              Renamed TMagFileCopyW to TIcsFileCopyW.
              Most Types have Ics added, so: TTaskResult now TIcsTaskResult.
              No longer needs Forms.
              Using TWideStringList instead of UStringArray, not Delphi 7
              Before creating directory check not a file of same name, delete it. 
20 Feb 2020 - V8.64 - Removed MultiThreaded no longer used, TIcsWndControl version now used.
22 Dec 2021 - V8.68 - DeleteFiles now supports Zipped property so files are zipped with .zip extension
                 before being deleted, useful for cleaning up old logs to save space.
              BOOL to Boolean.
