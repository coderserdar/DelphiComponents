  (There are other less used methods, see code below)

How to use FTPS (TLS/SSL/Implicit SSL) ?                           - V2.106
   First you need to have ICS-SSL and recompile the component and your project
   having symbol USE_SSL defined. Then specify the SSLType, either use
   explicit command AUTH after Open command to request TLS/SSL protection of
   the control channel on standard port from server, or you may use one of
   the high level commands which will automatically invoke Auth TLS/SSl once
   connected to the server. Implicit SSL is another method that establishes
   always a secure control channel (no AUTH command is required). To protect
   the data channel as well issue "PBSZ 0" and "PROT P" once the control
   channel is protected, or "PROT C" to clear the data channel.
   Currently there's only one spec available specifying explizit SSL (AUTH TLS)
   it's RFC4217.

How to use a Proxy or Firewall ?
   First of all, not all proxies or firewalls are the same. So have a look at
   product documentation. However, most products support a transparent proxy
   which doesn't require any special programming:
   1) Instead of connection to a remote FTP server, you connect to the proxy
   2) User name is replaced by user name, followed by '@' sign then followed
      by target remote FTP server host name.
   3) Password is usual remote FTP server password.
   4) Most require using Passive mode.
   Example: You want to connect to ftp.borland.com, using anonymous connection,
            company firewall/proxy is running on host named proxyserver.
            FtpCli1.HostName := 'proxyserver';
            FtpCli1.UserName := 'anonymous@ftp.borland.com';
            FtpCli1.Password := 'your.email@company';
            FtpCli1.Passive  := TRUE;

FEAT Command - numerous extensions have been made to the FTP protocol over
the past few years, although support of these new commands is very sporadic.
RFC2389 describes the FEAT command, which returns a multiline list of
extension supported by the server. Note that the SIZE command is an extension,
and not supported on all FTP servers. An internet-draft 'Extensions to FTP'
document the most useful new commands. The responses of common FTP servers
to FEAT are listed below:

The extensions supported by V2.94 of this component are:

MLST - Machine Listing, two listing commands:
  MLSD - much better version of LIST directory
  MLST - list a single file
  an example response from either command is as follows:
  size=17199;type=file;perm=fdrwa;create=20030616152030;
       modify=20031001190114; 00master.zip
  (note the date and time includes seconds which is missing from most LIST
   responses, and the time stamps should be UTC - but don't seem to be in
   WS_FTP Server)
MDTM - Get File Modification UTC Time - useful for resumed downloads,
       to see if file has changed
SIZE - Get File Size - useful for resumed downloads, to see if file has changed
MDTM YYYYMMDDHHMMSS[+-TZ] filename - Set File Modification Time after
                                     upload (+0 is UTC)
MFMT - Modify File Modification Time after upload (UTC)
MD5  - Check MD5 hash sum for specified file, used to check for corruption

and by V7.01 and later:

XCRC - Check CRC32B hash sum for specified file, or part file
XMD5 - Check MD5 hash sum for specified file, or part file
CLNT - Send client information to server
SITE INDEX - simple listing of file names
SITE ZONE - set time zone
SITE MSG - send message to server
SITE EXEC - run program on server
SITE PSWD - change user's password
SITE CMLSD - extended directory listing with sub-directories, on control channel
SITE DMLSD - extended directory listing with sub-directories
COMB - combine two or more files together
MODE - set Z compression or no compression
XCMLSD - extended directory listing with sub-directories, on control channel

UTF8 - server support UTF8 encoding, use OPTS UTF8 ON/OFF to enable or disable,
       beware some servers ignore ON/OFF and always turn UTF8 on
LANG - set server language for messages

              Made ControlSocket a readonly property (allow easy DNSLookup).
              Added a Port property.
Jan 25, 1998  V2.15
              Completely revised to make it asynchronous.
                This means that a new set of functions is born. They all have
                a name ending with Async. For example GetAsync. Asynchronous
                means that when you call the function, it returns almost
                immediately. The operation is done in the background.
                The asynchronous operation allows to make several request
                simultaneously WITHOUT using threads. Just use two or more
                TFtpClient and call each GetAsync (or other) method as those
                method returns almost instantly, all the request will be done
                in the background, generating the OnRequestDone when finished.
                Added a State property
                This allows to check for component work in the background.
                You can call methods only when State = ftpReady (except the
                Abort method which can be called at any time)
                The Asynchronous methods are the prefered ones.

              Added Pwd command
                Returns the current working directory on the server.

              Added CDup command
                Change to parrent directory on FTP server.

              Added DirResult property
                Parse the LastResponse property to return the directory.
                Do no always work when the server returns multi-line responses.
                (updated by Pwd, Cwd, CDup and Mkd commands).

              Changed function IsConnected to Connected, a read-only property.
                It's more object oriented.

              Replaced file I/O by stream I/O.
                It's the first step to allow Stream I/O outside of the component.

              New sample application (Delphi only now, CPP later).
                Every command has now a button to excercize it
                (async version only)

              The synchronous commands (old commands) are implemented by
                calling the asynchronous version and waiting.

              Multi-threaded property
                Tells the component how to wait for command completion.

              Removed the TWait component use.
                No need to have a TWait component.

             restart byte offset.
             Renamed Display to TriggerDisplay and made it virtual
             Used TriggerDisplay everywhere.

             OnStateChange when state is ftpWaitingBanner.
             Added checks for FLocalStream being destroyed.
Sep 5, 1999  V2.58 Heedong Lim <hdlim@dcenlp.chungbuk.ac.kr> found a missing
             assignation to FRequestResult in ControlSocketSessionConnected.

             property to switch to stream mode and LocalFileName to switch to
             normal file mode).
Jun 10, 2000 V2.67 Added NOFORMS conditional compile to be able to build a
             program (console mode, dll or other) without using the forms unit
             (because forms unit makes programs much bigger). See NOFORMS
             related comments in wsocket.pas source file for correct use.
             See also OnMessagePump event and Terminated property.
Jul 15, 2000 V2.68 Added ProxyPort property. Handled non standard port when
             connecting thru proxy.

             Peter Calum <pemca@tdk.dk> found some FTP server returning
             unusual status code (and not conforming to RFC !). I don't like to
             work arround other's bugs, but in this case this shouldn't hurt
             anything.
Jul 28, 2001 V2.77 Cleared FNextRequest in HighLevelAsync and TriggerRequestDone
             as suggested by Davie <smatters@smatters.com>.

             Accept 250 answer as well as 257 for MKD command as suggested by
             Simon Horup <cas@casdk.com>.
Feb 12, 2002 V2.82 "Soltann" <soltann@wanadoo.fr> added code to extract IP
             from passive mode reply so that transfer from another server is
             possible (See TargetIP in code).
Apr 06, 2002 V2.83 Added code 257 to allowed code list for CDUpAsync as
             suggest by <Davie@smatters.com>.

Oct 26, 2002 V2.85 Use wsoNoReceiveLoop option with data session.
             Set OnSessionAvalable handler before calling listen as suggested
             by Gunnar <gulb@gmx.de>.
Nov 11, 2002 V2.86 Changed FtpCliDeallocateHWnd argument from HWND to Cardinal
             becasue BCB doesn't like HWND when deriving acomponent from
             TFtpCli (BCB bug ?).
Jan 04, 2003 V2.87 Published OnError event
Feb 15, 2003 V2.88 Ignore empty lines in responses from server. Thansk to
             Chris Rendell <appsolca@yahoo.ca> for finding this one.

             server supports (note SupportedExtensions replaces SupportXXX
             flags which have gone)
Aug 30, 2004 V2.95 Added option ftpWaitUsingSleep so that WaitUntilReady use
             Sleep instead of MsgWaitForMultipleObjects because Angus said he
             found a case where it is faster to use Sleep.

             closed before winsock had sent the last block, seemed to happen
             only with put files about 9 to 10K in size, now waiting until
             wsocket has sent the correct number of characters
             Also raise exception if put fails with a wsocket error
             Thanks to Tobias Giesen <tobias@tgtools.de> for the fix

Sept 6, 2005 V2.101 64-bit support for Delphi 6 and later, for transfers larger
             than 2 gigs.  Note only LocalFileName mode supports resume over 2 gigs,
             due to limitation in TStream.  Check if seek fails and report error.
             Report real error opening local file (might be seek range error, not IO)
             by Angus Robertson, angus@magsys.co.uk

             added SitePswd command to change the account password on the server
             added SiteExec command to execute a progam at the server
             added SiteIndex command to download a recusive directory and file name listing
             added SiteZone command to get the server time zone difference from UTC
             added SiteMsg command to send a message to the server
             added SiteDmlsd command, similar to MLSD but optional argument -R or -subdirs
               for recursive directories, the path may be quoted if it includes spaces
             added SiteCmlsd command, similar to SiteDmlsd but uses control channel to
              avoid lots of small data channels sessions but may be limited by some clients
             NOTE: SiteDmlsd and SiteCmlsd are new commands supported only by ICS FTP Server,
               and both are used similarly to LIST and MLSD, ditto SITE INDEX
             new property StartTick which is tick count when file transfer started,
               and DurationMsecs which is how many ticks it took to finish, but note
               this is only set if the transfer finished normally, I think...
             added LookupFTPReq and LookupFtpState functions to ease logging state information
             file sizes and performance now reported in KBytes or MBytes instead of long bytes
             added OnZlibProgress event for progress, allow cancel and a message pump
                since zlib is blocking
             ZLIB use FileStream and a temporary file instead of MemoryStream which seems
                to be 10 to 20 times faster for large files (30 megs)
             ZlibWorkDir runtime property is path where temporary ZLIB files are written
                  defaulting to system temp path
             improved error handling decompressing ZLIB stream
             (usage of new commands is detailed above in quick reference)
Mar 24, 2008 V6.01 Bumped version number to 6.01
             Francois Piette made some changes to prepare code for Unicode.
Jun 25, 2008 V6.02 A. Garrels, ZlibOnProgress needs to be compiled conditionally.
             SSL code merged.
Jun 28, 2008 v6.03 **Breaking Change** enum item "sslTypeImplizit" renamed to
             "sslTypeImplicit".
May 01, 2008 V6.04 A.Garrels added function LocalStreamWriteString to prepare
             code for Unicode changed some types from char to AnsiChar.
May 02, 2008 V6.05 A.Garrels changed code to get the temporary directory for
             ZLIB in TCustomFtpCli.Create.
May 15, 2008 V6.06 A.Garrels added OverbyteIcsLibrary.pas to uses clause.
             Some type changes from String to AnsiString of published properties.
Aug 11, 2008 V6.07 A. Garrels - Type AnsiString rolled back to String.
Aug 27, 2008 V6.08 A. Garrels added UTF-8 and code page support.
Sep 20, 2008 V6.09 Angus fixed minor widestring bugs, updated FEAT comments for various FTP servers
             changed MdtmyyAsync so it no longer adds +0 since newer Serv-U then fails
             added FTP commands HOST hostname (before logon) and REIN (re-initialise connection)
             added ConnectHost that does Open/Host/User/Pass
Sep 21, 2008 V6.10 Angus made OnCommand always Unicode and OnDisplay/OnResponse always UTF8
             OnCommand event is now UnicodeString so not backward compatible (but not often used)
             simplified sending UTF8 commands for D2007 and earlier, so all arguments are sent UTF8
                and OnDisplay is consistent for all compilers
Oct 03, 2008 V6.10 A. Garrels moved IsDigit, IsCRLF, IsSpaceOrCRLF and StpBlk
                   to OverbyteIcsUtils.pas.
Oct 8, 2008  V6.11 Angus fixed minor error display bug in DoGetAsync
====================================================================
Oct 22, 2008 V7.00W wide version TFtpClientW and TSslFtpClientW
             Split to support WideStrings with Delphi 2007 and earlier, changes
             kept in step with original version.
Nov 14, 2008 V7.01W Angus removed old compiler code
             increased buffer sizes from 1460 and 4096, both to 32768
             fixed SOCKS settings never implemented properly and lost after one connection
             added XCMLSD, XDMLSD and LANG commands and check matching FEAT options
             improved UTF8 support so command responses are no longer UTF-8 with D2007
             all FTP display events now UnicodeString, all response parsing functions widestring
Nov 16, 2008 V7.02 Arno simplified some code page related code, added option
             ftpAutoDetectCodePage which actually detects UTF-8 only, exchanged
             RawByteString by AnsiString in several routines.
Nov 18, 2008 V7.03 Arno - Protection level on the data channel was not set
             properly. Set it only in case of PROT command succeeded.
Nov 21, 2008 V7.04 Arno - Allow C++ Builder
Jan 7, 2009  V7.05 Angus - allow 200 response for HOST (for ws_ftp server)
Apr 6, 2009  V7.06 Angus check response for XMD5 properly (220 or 250 and no file name)
Apr 16, 2009 V7.07 Angus assume STREAM64, USE_MODEZ, USE_ONPROGRESS64_ONLY, USE_BUFFERED_STREAM
             Remove old conditional and suppressed code, OnProgress gone (BREAKING CHANGE)
Jan 4, 2010  V7.08 added TriggerResponse virtual and CreateSocket virtual
             ConnectAsync and ConnectHostAsync methods now trigger FEAT command
             Thanks to "Anton Sviridov" <ant_s@rambler.ru>
Jun 9, 2010  V7.09 Angus - ConnectAsync and ConnectHostAsync methods no longer trigger FEAT command
             Added ConnectFeatAsync and ConnectFeatHostAsync methods which do trigger FEAT command
Sep 8, 2010  V7.10 Arno - If conditional BUILTIN_THROTTLE is defined the
             bandwidth control uses TWSocket's built-in throttle code rather
             than TFtpClient's.
Sep 19, 2010 V7.11 Arno - Do not call DataSocketPutDataSent twice! This fixes
             a bug that showed up with experimental built-in throttle but could
             also trigger without as well. For instance, if file size is smaller
             or equal send buffer size a second call to DataSocketPutDataSent
             turns on the shutdown timeout (loop) even though data is not yet
             sent. DataSocketPutDataSent MUST only be called once to init
             the send loop.
Sep 20, 2010 V7.12 Angus - ensure FMultiThreaded in TIcsWndControl is set correctly and
               not locally here
Oct 10, 2010 V7.13 Arno - MessagePump changes/fixes.
Oct 15, 2010 V7.14 Arno - Fake AUTHTLS request/response if renegotiation is
             not available and the SSL is already established.
Nov 08, 2010 V7.15 Arno improved final exception handling, more details
             in OverbyteIcsWndControl.pas (V1.14 comments).
Nov 11, 2010 V7.16 Arno re-enabled component notification for FDataSocket and
             FControlSocket that was disabled accidentally in V7.13 rev. #610 in
             method CreateSocket by creating the instances with a nil owner.
Nov 17, 2010 V7.17 Arno published property ProxyPort.
Feb 09, 2011 V7.18 Arno added HTTP v1.1 proxy-support and some conditional
             defines to be able to build with smaller internal buffers.
Feb 13, 2011 V7.19 Arno fixed a bug in TCustomFtpCli.ControlSocketSessionClosed
             that caused RequestDone being triggered with error code null if
             the server unexpectedly closed the connection without sending any
             response. Error messages from proxy servers are now available.
Feb 14, 2011 V7.20 Arno - Clear HTTP tunnel server name from data and ctrl
             socket properly as well as properties LastResponse, ErrorMessage
             and StatusCode in method OpenAsync.
Feb 15, 2011 V7.21 Arno - HTTP tunnel server name now cleared correctly.
             Use function WSocketIsProxyErrorCode from OverbyteIcsWSocket.pas.
Mar 01, 2011 V7.22 Arno - **Warning, possibly a breaking change**. The component
             does no longer enforce passive mode with native FTP-proxy
             connections, it's an option now.
Apr 15, 2011 V7.23 Arno prepared for 64-bit.
May 21, 2011 V7.24 Arno - Call CloseDelayed rather than Close in
             TCustomFtpCli.DoneQuitAsync in order to avoid error #10053 in
             OnSessionClosed event with SSL.
Jul 24, 2011 V7.26 Arno added published property DataSocketSndBufSize
             and public property DataSocketRcvBufSize. Increase DataSocketSndBufSize
             in order to make uploads faster. Both values default to value 8192
             which is the default winsock size. Removed useless call to
             WSocket_getsockopt in TCustomFtpCli.DataSocketPutSessionAvailable.
Oct 24, 2011 V7.27 Arno - Set state ftpInternalReady in DoneQuitAsync.
             Check for component connected in PortAsync.
Jan 20, 2012 V7.28 Arno - If the control connection closes with error code
             after QUIT response has been received OK we may safely ignore this
             error.
Apr 06, 2012 V7.29 **** BREAKING CHANGE ****
             Arno - Request type of two methods changed/corrected:
             1) ConnectFeatAsync() from ftpConnectAsync to ftpConnectFeatAsync.
             2) ConnectFeatHostAsync() from ftpConnectHostAsync to ftpConnectFeatHostAsync.
             These changes might require to adjust your OnRequestDone handler.
May 2012 - V8.00 - IPv6 changes - added property SocketFamily, etc.  Commented as IPv6
Mar 18, 2013 V8.01 - Angus added LocalAddr6 for IPv6
             Note: SocketFamily must be set to sfAny, sfIPv6 or sfAnyIPv6 to
                   allow a host name to resolve to an IPv6 address.
Mar 10, 2013 V8.02 - Arno added property ExternalIPv4. If specified, usually NAT
             router's public IP, this IP is sent with the PORT command to the server.
             Makes active mode possible behind NAT in case the router isn't smart
             enough to handle active mode automatically or when the control connection
             is encrypted. The NAT router then must also be configured to forward
             incoming packets from the server properly to the client, specifying a
             DataPortRange helps in this context.
Jul 24, 2013 V8.03 - Angus added more error reporting for not ready and more
                debug logging.
             Fixed bug in WaitUntilReady that meant some sync methods with multiple
               commands randomly terminated prematurely allowing further commands to
               be sent usually resulting in not ready errors.
Feb 07, 2014 V8.04 - Arno, in DoneQuitAsync call FControlSocket.Close rather than
             CloseDelayed.
Dec 02, 2014 V8.05 - Angus fixed PBSZAsync set incorrect TFtpFct
Dec 10, 2014 V8.06 - Angus added SslHandshakeRespMsg for better error handling
Oct 07, 2015 V8.07 - Update SslServerName for SSL SNI support allowing server to
                        select correct SSL context and certificate
Oct 25, 2015 V8.08 - Angus report SSL certificate check failed in HandshakeDone event
Feb 23, 2016 V8.09 - Angus renamed TBufferedFileStream to TIcsBufferedFileStream
Nov 10, 2016 V8.37 - Added extended exception information, set SocketErrs = wsErrFriendly for
                      some more friendly messages (without error numbers)
Mar 3, 2017  V8.42 - Angus TULargeInteger now ULARGE_INTEGER
Jun 21, 2017 V8.49 - Angus using IcsGetFileSizeW instead of local version
Mar 6, 2019  V8.60 - Added AddrResolvedStr read only property which is the IPv4/IPv6
                       address to which the client is trying to connect.
                     Added IP address and port to 500 Connect error.
                     Added round robin DNS lookup if DNSLookup returns multiple
                        IP addresses so they are used in turn after a failure
                        when the component is called repeatedly.
Jun 18, 2019 V8.62  Set ftpFeatProtC when no PROT parameters passed.
Nov 3, 2019  V8.63  Added Option ftpFixPasvLanIP for when '227 Entering Passive Mode ()'
                      returns a LAN IP instead of a WAN IP, so use control IP instead.
                      This fixes failed downloads if the FTP server is behind a NAT
                      router and is not configured to present the external IP.
                    Log IP addresses and ports for passive connections to ease debugging.
Oct 2, 2020 V8.65 Only increase TCP buffer size, don't reduce it below default
                      of 64K, generally better to let Windows TCP autotuning set size.
Mar 02, 2021 V8.66 Renegotiation of connection no longer supported, not recommended.
Aug 07, 2021 V8.67 Replaced Stream.Seek with Stream.Position.
                   Support option ftpFixPasvLanIP for PUT/APPE uploads as well as
                     downloads, see V8.63.
                   Support IPv6 for PUT/APPE uploads as well as downloads.
Nov 27, 2021 V8.68 Using the PORT command to set Active mode, prevent other FTP clients
                     sharing the same port/addr, usually with a small port pool.
                   Improved AbortComponent so ReasonPhrase now reports exception
                      that caused it, such as out of memory which previously needed
                      a BgException event handler.

              SSL demo applications can be found in /Delphi/SslInternet.
