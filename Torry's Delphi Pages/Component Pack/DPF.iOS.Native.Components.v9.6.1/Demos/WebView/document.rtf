We practiced programming contests with different team members and strategies for many years, and saw a lot of other teams do so too. \par\par\cf1\f0\fs24\qj\b0\i0\ulnone From this we developed a theory about how an optimal team should behave during a contest. However, a refined strategy is not a must: The World Champions of 1995, Freiburg University, were a rookie team, and the winners of the 1994 Northwestern European Contest, Warsaw University, met only two weeks before that contest.}
