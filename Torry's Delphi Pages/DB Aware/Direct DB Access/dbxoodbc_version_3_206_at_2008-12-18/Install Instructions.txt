How to install DbxOOdbc - Open Source DbExpress driver for ODBC
---------------------------------------------------------------


Source code version (compile dbxopenodbc statically into your program)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the recommended method.

It avoids possibility of incompatible versions of dbxoodbc.dll at runtime.
It allows you to compile dbxopenodbc with your own specific options (see defines).
It gives better tracing when your are debugging.

What to do
----------
Copy all files in this directory to either your application source directory,
a directory in your Delphi LibPath, or a new directory which you must then
add to your Delphi LibPath.

Add "uses dbxopenodbc" to any unit in your application.
This causes Delphi to compile dbxopenodbc statically into your application.


DLL version (load dbxoodbc.dll dynamically at runtime)
------------------------------------------------------

What to do
----------
Copy dbxoodbc.dll to your executable directory, a directory in your PATH.

If you want different options (see defines in dbxopenodbc.pas source),
open project dbxoodbc.dpr, make the required changes, and rebuild to create
a new dbxoodbc.dll.


Design time
-----------
At design time, Delphi cannot use the source code version of dbxopenodbc.
To connect at design time, you must have dbxoodbc.dll in your path.


Multiple DbExpress drivers
--------------------------
If you want to load more than one driver, or want to decide which driver to load
at runtime, you cannot use static linking at all, since if you statically link
the static driver will always take precedence over any dynamically loaded driver.
In this case you have to use the DLL version and must   load dynamically at runtime.


TSQLConnection settings for Dbxoodbc
------------------------------------

Simple method
-------------

  Set TSQLConnection properties in the object inspector before you connect

  .LibaryName = dbxoodbc.dll (must be fully qualified if not on the search path)
  .GetDriverFunc = getSQLDriverODBC (NB this is case-sensitive)
  .VendorLib = ODBC32.DLL
  .Params - As described dbxconnections.ini below - Database is required, others optional

(.LibraryName is required, but is actually ignored if you compile DbxOpenOdbc.pas statically)


Long method
-----------
This method adds driver and connection to the list of known drivers and connections;
This makes it easier to change drivers by selecting TSQLConnection.DriverName and     TSQLConnection.ConnectionName drop-down in the Object Inspector for TSQLConnection.

  1. Retrieve DbExpress INI file names from registry
     '\Software\Borland\DBExpress' Value 'Driver Registry File'
     (The default ini file names will be:
      C:\Program Files\Common Files\Borland Shared\DBExpress\dbxdrivers.ini)
      C:\Program Files\Common Files\Borland Shared\DBExpress\dbxconnections.ini)

  2. In dbxdrivers.ini file
     (see sample dbxdrivers.ini in this directory)

  a. Add line to '[INSTALLEDDRIVERS]' section
       drivername=1 (eg 'Dbx Open Odbc Driver=1') (The driver name can be any name you like)

  b. Add new [drivername] section ie [Dbx Open Odbc Driver], with following 3 lines
       LibraryName=dbxoodbc.dll        (Not case-sensitive in Windows)
       GetDriverFunc=getSQLDriverODBC  (NB This is case-sensitive, even in Windows)
       VendorLib=ODBC32.DLL

  3. In dbxconnections.ini file
     (see sample dbxconnections.ini in this directory)

  a. Add '[ConnectionName]' section with following 4 lines
       DriverName=Dbx Open Odbc Driver (or whatever you called it in dbxdrivers.ini)
       Database=ODBC DSN name, or ODBC connection string, or ? for Driver Prompt
       User_Name=user name (this can be ommitted)
       Password=password (this can be ommitted)

  b. You can have as many different [ConnectionName] sections as you like, so
     you can pre-configure several ODBC connection settings.


How to specify ODBC DSN (Data Source Name)
------------------------------------------

Edit TSQLConnection.Params in the Object inspector (or set in code)

Database is the ODBC DSN name (must be already set up using Windows or Linux ODBC admin)

Example -
TSQLConnection.Params
   Database:   'ODBCDSN'
   User_Name:  'USER'
   Password:   'SECRET'


Alternatively, you can specify Database as the complete ODBC connect string

Examples using complete ODBC connect string -
   Database:   'DSN=Example;UID=USER;PWD=SECRET'
   Database:   'DSN=Example;DB=MyDB;HOSTNAME=MyHost;TIMEOUT=10;UID=USER;PWD=SECRET''
   Database:   'FILEDSN=FileDsnExample'
   Database:   'DRIVER=Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb);DBQ=c:\work\odbctest\odbctest.mdb'

Alternatively, you can specify Database as '?'
The driver will then prompt for the connect parameters when you connect.

Example -
   Database:   '?'


Extra Dbxopenodbc options in Connect string
-------------------------------------------
As well as the standard ODbc connect parameters, you can specify
options private to DbxOpenOdbc in the Database connect string.
These options are stripped out before connect string is passed to Odbc.

DbxOpenOdbc options (and their default settings if not specified)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Boolean options - Specify 0, 1 or X for default

 coMetaData=1;
   Normally, we query the ODBC driver to check if it supports metadata.
   When MetaData=0, we will never ask for metadata.
   You may want to do this if asking for metadata hurts performance,
   or if a particular ODBC driver has bugs in the metadata handling.
 coSchemaFlt=0; (default=1 for Oracle)
   When 0 catalog entries for all schemas (owners) are passed back to SqlExpress.
   Sometimes this can hit performance, particularly if you
   have many tables in the catalog. When this option is 1, we only pass back
   objects where schema (owner) matches the SchemaName connection option (which
   DbExpress automatally sets to be the User_Name of the connection).
 coTrimChar=0;
   Applies to FIXED LENGTH string fields only.
   When =0, we pass fixed length strings back to DbExpress unchanged;
   Normally the DBMS pads strings that are shorter than the defined length with spaces,
   Sometimes this is undesirable (eg, for CHAR(5) you store "Hi", but get retrieve "Hi   ")
   When =1, we strip off trailing spaces from fixed length strings.
 coMapInt64ToBcd=1;
   When 1, Int64 is mapped to BCD. (This is the way Borland DbExpress drivers behave
   since DbExpress does not natively support the Int64 field type).
 coMapSmallBcdToNative=0;
   When 1, 4-digit integer BCD fields are mapped to Int16,
   9-digit integer BCD fields are mapped to Int32, and other BCD (decimal) fields
   with 10 or fewer signficant digits are mapped to Double.
   (BCD fields with 11 or more digits stay as BCD).
 coCatalog=1;  (default =0 for Informix, SQLLite, ThinkSQL)
   ("Catalog" is the ODBC term for Database name, eg "Northwind" in MS SqlServer).
   Normally, we check if the ODBC driver supports Catalog.
   When 1, we pass back the name of the catalog to DbExpress when requested.
   Sometimes the driver incorrectly indicates catalog support, or sometimes including
   catalog info can be cumbersome, so set this option to 0 to prevent Catalog info.
 coIgnoreUnkFldType=0;   (default=1 for Informix)
   When 0, dbxoodbc will raise an exception if it fetches an unknown field type
   When 1, any unkown field types will be ignored
 coMapCharAsBDE=0;
   When 1, String fields > 255 chars are passed back to DbExpress as string blobs.
 coEmptyStrParam=1;
   When 1, empty (ie string of zero length) are allowed.
   However. some ODBC drivers do not correctly handle string with zero length.
   For such drivers it is necessary to replace a zero-length string with null,
   and we will do this automatically if EmptyStrParam=0
 coMixedFetch=0;
   When 1, enable Block Cursors even when fetching large fields
 coEnableBCD=1
   When=0, BCD fields are mapped as Float (this is how BDE behaves)
 coMaxBCD=0
   When 1, BCD fields of any length are mapped as 32 significant digits.
   This is to handle cases where the ODBC driver returns wrong information.

Integer options
 coBlobChunkSize=40960;
 coNetPacketSize=4096;

N.B. Default settings listed above might change in the future
