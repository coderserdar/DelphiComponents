ver. 1.101 12-12-2005
Added:
1. 
New indices.
Separate case, order, nulldirection, sizecompare
It plans use these indices in "order by, group by" for big table sorting.
SYNTAX
SELECT ss, ns FROM "a"
order by ss case false      null top false      count 1,  ns desc case false
            case false/true null top false/true count [compare] (strings/wide field)

Default is:
case true,
null top true,
count compare field length (string, widestring).

This is a option order by.


2.
I added new function for info blocked records in sql.

Flag:
ISRECORDLOCKED
ISUNDELETEDRECORD
ISPROTECTDELETERECORD
ISPROTECTUPDATERECORD
ISMARKASBADRECORD

SYNTAX
select ISRECORDLOCKED, * from xx

select (not ISRECORDLOCKED), * from xx

select ISRECORDLOCKED, * from xx
where ISRECORDLOCKED

select ISRECORDLOCKED, * from xx
where not ISRECORDLOCKED

select * from xx
where ISRECORDLOCKED

update xx set a=12
where not ISRECORDLOCKED

delete from xx 
where not ISRECORDLOCKED

3.
New syntax for delete record
Use top or down for specify count delete.

SYNTAX
delete top 1 FROM "TestArray"
or
delete top 10 FROM "TestArray" useindex YourIndex

delete down 1 FROM "TestArray"
or
delete down 10 FROM "TestArray" useindex YourIndex


ver. 1.077 21-11-2005
Added:
New function for manage lockrecord.
Now user decides how and when record has to be blocked or 
Set true RecLockedBeforeEdit (TfsTable) for locked before edit.
    Procedure LockRecord;
    Procedure UnLockRecord;
    Procedure UnLockRecordAll;
    Function RecordIsLocked: boolean;
    Next version implemented select for update 
    and select .. for xxx where LockRecord.

New prop for TfsTable
RecLockedType for decides how Lock Record.
If Use RecLockedType = tluDatabase then lock is as database.RecLocking

New prop InRange for info StartRange.

RecNo is now work.Tested on D 5,6,7 and D10 but not full.
If use supportrecno and Range and inserted record recno is show bad number.
Next version should by ok.
I work over ddl, triggers, constraints, events and amall 
documentation at present and it lacks me time.

  Slow if use big table.
  This is first realase. RecNo is only logical position record of dataset (fstable, fsquery).
  Use TfsTable.SupportRecno, TfsQuery.SupportRecno to ON/OFF.
