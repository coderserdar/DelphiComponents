!TOPIC 811 VRebuild
The VRebuild unit is used to rebuild a variable length Fileblock. It will
construct new data and index files from the original data file. It is
similar to the 0726Rebuild unit, which is used to rebuild Fileblocks
containing fixed length records.

The VRebuild unit uses the Restruct and ReIndex units to do its work.

This procedure rebuilds the Fileblock of the name FBlName. For this
operation to succeed, every undeleted record must begin with a longint of
value 0. A backup copy of the corrupt ".DAT" file of the corrupt Fileblock
should be made before the use of RebuildVFileBlock for maximum
protection. The procedure works in the following fashion:

!NOWRAP
  1) Renames the ".DAT" file to ".SAV", if there is not already
     ".SAV" file. If there is a ".SAV" file, it assumes that to be a
     proper file from a previous rebuild attempt.
  2) Calls BTCreateFileBlock with the name FBlName, record length
     DatSlen, NumberOfKeys keys and the index descriptor IID, then
     opens the fileblock with BTOpenFileBlock.
  3) Reads every record from the ".SAV" file and calls BTAddRec in the
     new Fileblock.
  4) For every single key (1 to NumberOfKeys) reads the record from the
     new ".DAT" file and adds the key with BTAddKey.
  5) Closes the new fileblock.
  6) Erases the ".SAV" file.
!WRAP

To implement step 4 the user must provide a function that will create the
desired key from the record. The address of the function must be passed in
FuncBuildKey. This function must be compiled under the FAR model, and it
may not be nested within any other procedure or function. It should be of
the following form:

  {$F+}
  function BuildKeyFunc(var DatS; KeyNr : Word) : IsamKeyStr;

The rebuild procedure is terminated immediately in case of a fatal I/O
error. The remaining ".SAV" file should not be deleted so a following
reconstruction may attempt to use it. If during the rebuild a duplicate
primary key is encountered, the record with all its previously entered keys
are removed from the fileblock. The contents of the record and its
corresponding keys are written into a file with the extension ".MSG".
This can be examined later, with TYPE or a program like LIST. No file
with an ".MSG" extension exists if no duplicate keys are found during the
rebuild.
