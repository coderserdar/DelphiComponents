!TOPIC 532 NWFile

NWFile provides some access to NetWare's file and directory services.
Generally this unit should be viewed as an adjunct to some of the other
NetWare units. It was not designed to provide a plethora of NetWare file
and directory routines because it is far easier to use the corresponding
DOS routines. The provided routines include:

   . parsing a DOS, NetWare, or UNC filename into a NetWare server,
        volume, and path
   . setting and getting file attributes
   . locking and unlocking file regions directly

NetWare's extra file attributes. These attributes are returned with the
normal DOS file attributes (for these bit values, see the Borland Pascal
or DOS documentation). nwfaExecuteOnly defines the file as being an
executable program (an EXE or COM file). Once this attribute is set it
cannot be unset. Note that it is a redefinition of the Volume Label bit
for DOS files on local drives. nwfaShareable defines the file as being
shareable for those programs who do not open the file in a shareable mode.

transactional bit. A file that has this bit set in its extended attribute
byte will be tracked by NetWare's Transaction Tracking Services (TTS).

function 0532NWFile.nwGetFileAttr(FileName : string; var FAttr : byte;
                       var ExtFAttr : byte) : TnwErrorCode;

Return the normal and extended file attributes for a file.

The file name can be specified in either DOS, NetWare, or UNC format. This
function extracts the server and volume from the name by using
0541nwParseFileName. If the file is on a NetWare server, both the DOS
attributes and the NetWare attributes for the file are returned.
FAttr contains the DOS-style attributes. This bit-mapped byte is
interpreted as follows:

!NOWRAP
;!TABLE
         7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
         |     |  |  |  |  |  +--Read only
         |     |  |  |  |  +-----Hidden
         |     |  |  |  +--------System
         |     |  |  +-----------Execute-only
         |     |  +--------------Subdirectory
         |     +-----------------Modified since archiving
         +-----------------------Shareable
!WRAP

The bits have their normal DOS interpretation, with the exception of the
Execute-Only and Shareable flags, which are Novell specific. See the
descriptions of nwfaExecuteOnly and nwfaShareable earlier in this section.

The extended file attributes parameter, ExtFAttr, is a bit-mapped byte,
interpreted as follows:

!NOWRAP
;!TABLE
         7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
         |  |  |  |     +--------Search mode
         |  |  |  +--------------Transactions allowed
         |  |  +-----------------Fast indexing
         |  +--------------------Read Audit
         +-----------------------Write Audit
!WRAP

You can use the defines nweaSearchMode..nweaWriteAudit described earlier
in this section to access these bits.

function 0532NWFile.nwLockRecord(Handle : word; Start, Len : nwLong;
                      TimeOut : word) : TnwErrorCode;

Lock a region of a file.

This routine makes a NetWare-specific call to lock part of a file. Handle
is the DOS file handle of the already opened file, Start is the starting
byte (zero based) of the region, and Len is the number of bytes to lock.
Timeout is the length of time in clock ticks (18.2 ticks per second) to
try to lock the file region. nwLockRecord returns when either the region
is locked, or when TimeOut ticks expire. A result of zero means that the
lock was successful, a non-zero result means the lock attempt was
unsuccessful.

                         var Path : string) : TnwErrorCode;

Parse a file name into a NetWare server, volume, and full path.

This routine takes a file name in DOS, NetWare, or UNC format and attempts
to extract the server handle and name, volume name, and remaining path
from it. The input filename does not have to be in uppercase, as the
routine internally converts it to uppercase.

!TOPIC 543 nwUNCtoNetWare
!NOINDEX
function 0532NWFile.nwUNCtoNetWare(UNC : string; var NW : string) : TnwErrorCode;

Convert a UNC filename to a NetWare filename.

This routine is used internally to convert a UNC style filename
(\\SERVER\VOLUME\PATH) to a NetWare style pathname (SERVER\VOLUME:PATH).
No checking is done on the validity of the server name or volume name. The
only checking done is to verify the basic format (i.e., the string starts
with a double backslash, and so on).

function 0532NWFile.nwUnlockRecord(Handle : word;
                        Start, Len : nwLong) : TnwErrorCode;

Unlock a region of a file.

This routine makes a NetWare-specific call to unlock part of a file that
was locked with 0540nwLockRecord. Handle is the DOS file handle of the already
opened file. The values of Start and Len must agree with those passed to
the original call to nwLockRecord. nwUnlockRecord returns zero if the lock
was released, otherwise it returns an error code.
