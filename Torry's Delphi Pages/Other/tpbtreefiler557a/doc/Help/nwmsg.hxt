NWMsg provides access to NetWare's broadcast message facilities. The
routines in this unit include:

   . setting and getting the workstation's broadcast mode
   . getting a saved broadcast message
   . sending a broadcast message to other connections
   . sending a message to the server console

The workstation broadcast modes used to tell the NetWare how to handle
received messages. Use bmDisplayBoth to display messages received from a
server and from other users. Use bmDisplayServer to display messages
received from a server and discard messages from other users. Use
bmStoreServer save messages received from a server for later retrieval and
discard messages from other users. Use bmStoreBoth to save messages
received from a server and save messages from other users. Note that a
server only saves one message at a time for a workstation. If a new
message arrives, the older one is overwritten.

                               var Message : string) : TnwErrorCode;

Return a broadcast message.

If the workstation's broadcast mode is set to one of the 'store' options,
this routine retrieves a stored message. If there is no message, then the
returned string is empty.

                            var Mode : TnwBroadcastMode) : TnwErrorCode;

Return the workstation's current broadcast mode.

Each workstation has its own broadcast mode. Currrently there is only one
broadcast mode per workstation, however this might change with future
versions of the VLM Requester.

!TOPIC 596 nwSendBroadcastMessage
!NOINDEX
function 0591NWMsg.nwSendBroadcastMessage(Server : TnwServer; Message : string;
                                var ToList : TnwConnList) : TnwErrorCode;

Send a message to a list of connections.

The message length is dependent on the version of NetWare. Version 3.11
and higher allow up to 254 characters, but earlier versions allow only up
to 58 characters. The maximum number of connection numbers in the list
also varies with server version. For NetWare 3.11 and higher, the maximum
number of connections that a message can be sent to is 62. For earlier
versions of NetWare, the maximum is 254 connections.

The message is not guaranteed to arrive (it depends on many things,
including whether the receiving workstation has a relevant broadcast
mode).

                                Message : string) : TnwErrorCode;

Send a message to the file server console.

This routine sends a message of at most 55 characters. The message is seen
immediately if the server is acting in console mode, but will be stored
for later display if not.

                            Mode : TnwBroadcastMode) : TnwErrorCode;

Set the workstation's broadcast mode.

If you alter the broadcast mode for an application, it is advisable to
save the state of the broadcast mode prior to changing it and to restore
it to the original value before terminating the program.
